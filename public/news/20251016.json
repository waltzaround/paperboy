      "topic": "Cross-Party Tributes Honour the Life and Legacy of Jim Bolger",
      "whyItMatters": "Remembering the leader who oversaw major economic reforms, the introduction of MMP, and the beginning of modern Treaty settlements helps explain the foundations of contemporary New Zealand politics.",
      "content": "In a session dedicated entirely to his memory, parliamentarians from all parties paid tribute to former Prime Minister Jim Bolger. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon moved the motion to adjourn, remembering Bolger as a leader with an \"innate sense of fairness\" who guided New Zealand through sweeping economic, social, and constitutional changes. A recurring theme was the complexity of his legacy; speakers acknowledged controversial policies like the Employment Contracts Act while universally praising his courage and conviction in initiating major Treaty of Waitangi settlements with iwi like Waikato-Tainui and Ngāi Tahu. Leaders from Labour, Te Pāti Māori, and the Greens highlighted his evolution in later life, where he championed causes like fair pay agreements, and his consistent belief that the nation's success was tied to the success of Māori.",

          "quote": "Jim Bolger's life is full of contradictions. His Government sold the Bank of New Zealand and then he was the inaugural chair of the new Government-owned Kiwibank. His Government ushered in the Employment Contracts Act and then subsequently he chaired a working group that led to the establishment of fair pay agreements."
