        "content": "Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): Point of order, Madam Speaker. Thank you, Madam Speaker. When Ministers give incorrect information in answers to oral questions, there is an onus on them coming back to the House and doing what David Seymour has just done and stating that they gave incorrect information, but there is also an onus on them to provide the correct information.\n: David Seymour has just made it clear to the House that he provided incorrect information, but he hasn't done the second part of that, which is to discharge his responsibility for correcting incorrect information; it is to provide what the correct information actually is. So he has indicated that the Fire Service were disrupted more than once by having faulty equipment in responding to calls, but he hasn't told us how many times.\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Does the Minister have the answer on hand? If not, the possibility is either now or at the earliest opportunity.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Deputy Prime Minister): Well, I'm sorry, but the Leader of the Opposition's assertion is incorrect. You do have an obligation to address questions, which I did at the time, and to correct any incorrect information, which I have. There's no further obligation.\nRt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): Point of order, Madam Speaker. David Seymour sought leave to correct an answer, and on that basis, the House unanimously gave him leave to do so. He didn't seek leave to withdraw information; he sought leave to correct information. He has not done that.\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: So the advice I have is that if the Minister knows the answer, he should give it to the House, and if he doesn't, he should give it to the House as soon as possible.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Deputy Prime Minister): Well, with the greatest of respect, the problem is that there may not always be an answer. Therefore, you can't always be—that's why you're required to address the question; not answer it.\nRt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): Point of order, Madam Speaker. If the Minister does not know the answer, then how would he have corrected the answer? He must know the answer; therefore, he is obliged to tell the House what the answer is, given that the previous answer he gave was incorrect.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Deputy Prime Minister): I just really hope that this is not how Labour Party logic works every day, because the simple fact is that while the statement made has been advised—[Interruption]\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet—the Minister is speaking.\nHon DAVID: SEYMOUR: —to be incorrect, that does not mean that a correct answer is available. It may be that the answer given was simply erroneous. That's why it has being withdrawn, and with the incorrect part removed, the answer is now correct.\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: The Minister is saying that he doesn't have an answer available—\n: Hon David Seymour: You guys are simple.\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: —so, yeah.\n: Hon David Seymour: Simple, simple.\nRt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): Point of order, Madam Speaker. That isn't what he's saying; he appears to be saying he's not willing to give it.\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: No, that's not what I heard. I heard him say—\n: Hon David Seymour: Simple, simple man.\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: —there wasn't an answer available. That is what he just said to the House.\nRt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): So, a further point of order, Madam Speaker. If it, therefore, becomes clear that David Seymour has been advised what the number is and he has chosen not to give that information to the House, will he still be in breach of the House, as he would have been had he not corrected it?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Deputy Prime Minister): Speaking to the point of order, maybe I can help the member out. I've been advised that a number is not currently available, so therefore it's not possible to answer the question—which is what I've been trying to get through to the simple man over there this whole time.\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: Yeah, that's fine. There's currently—\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: A further point of order, Madam Speaker.\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: I'm accepting that there's not currently an answer available that the Minister has at this point in time—\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Yep, I'm accepting that, too.\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: That's what he said.\nRt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): You'll note that this is a serious matter, where a Minister has to seek leave to correct an answer in order to not breach the privileges of the House. I have raised the issue with you correctly and appropriately.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes.\nRt Hon CHRIS: HIPKINS: I haven't insulted the Minister.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No.\nRt Hon CHRIS: HIPKINS: Multiple times in his answers to that, he chose to insult me and attack me in breach of the rules of the House. What would the consequence of that be for him?\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: Look, I will follow up and have a look at the Hansard because I didn't pick up insult. I know there was a bit of to-ing and fro-ing coming from the Minister, but I didn't pick up the insult, and so I will look at the Hansard and I will come back to you.\n: ORAL QUESTIONS\n: QUESTIONS TO MINISTERS\n1.: Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition) to the Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON (Prime Minister): Yes.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: If the economy has turned the corner, as he's repeatedly claimed, why have record numbers of New Zealanders been applying for KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals in the past 12 months?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, as I've explained to the member before, it's no doubt been a very challenging time for the New Zealand economy. The previous Government drove up spending, inflation, interest rates, put the economy into recession, and people lose their jobs as a consequence of that. But there are good signs. It's good to see that job ads are up 3.5 percent. It's good to see that building consents are up 12 percent just in the last quarter.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: Is he aware that under his leadership, hardship withdrawals from KiwiSaver have outnumbered first-home withdrawals from KiwiSaver month after month, when previously it only happened once in 10 years?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, as I said to the member in my answer to his first question, it has been a difficult time for the New Zealand economy. We inherited a recession that was probably the worst in 35 years. There was a long COVID hangover, thanks to the previous Government being the second biggest spending Government in the Western world—spending $66 billion that no one seems to know where it went to. The reality, though, is that things are getting better: exports are up 4 percent; interest rates are down 300 basis points.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: Has increasing the cost of doctors visits, home insurance, public transport, car registration, the price of going to a pharmacy, and student loans during a cost of living crisis made things better or worse for everyday kiwi families?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I acknowledge that many of those things that drive inflation, and particularly electricity but also, most importantly, council rates—that member opposes council rates. If he wanted to tackle that problem, he would come on board with the Government's initiative to put a cap on rates.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: Is the Government considering a law change to ban homeless people from central business districts; if so, why?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Our Government's doing everything we can to support people who are in homeless situations, and that's why you've seen 300 more places made available through Housing First. A hundred of those 300 homes and accommodation have already been built; 200 in Auckland. But, of course, our Government, our Ministers, will work with lots of people to see what we can do.\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Point of order, Madam Speaker. It was a very straight forward question: is the Government considering a law change to ban homeless people from central business districts, if so; why? I didn't ask the Prime Minister, what does he think about homelessness; I asked him specifically whether they're considering a change to the law to ban homeless people from CBDs.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Prime Minister did say that the Government will do what they can. I would like to know if the Prime Minister could elaborate on that to answer that specific part of the question.\n: Rt Hon Christopher Luxon: I'm quite comfortable I've answered one of those legs of those two legs in that question.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: Is the Government considering a law change to ban homeless people from central business districts?\nRt Hon Christopher Luxon: There have been no Cabinet decisions or discussion on that topic.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: Has the Cabinet discussed a law change to ban homeless people from central business districts?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: In answer to the answer I just gave the member for his last question: no.\nChlöe Swarbrick: When, if ever, will the Prime Minister finally respond to my many invitations to walk the streets of Auckland Central and meet the people, including the children, who his Government's policies have made homeless?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, no disrespect to the member, but when she was part of a Labour-Greens Government and had one of her members as the minister for homelessness we saw a billion dollars spent on emergency housing and a 37 percent increase in homelessness. This Government's record on housing I would line up against Labour, Greens, Te Pāti Māori any day of the week. The great Labour Prime Ministers of their era must be rolling in their grave with the legacy of Labour—\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: OK, that's enough.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: If booting people out of emergency accommodation has fixed the homelessness problem, why is the Government now considering changing the law to ban homeless people?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I reject the characterisation of that question, because here's the deal on housing: this Government has delivered housing affordability for people who want to purchase a house or to rent a house. This is the Government that took 6,000 people off the State house wait-list while that member increased fourfold over six years. This is the Government that took 3,200 households out of emergency housing. This is the Government that is doing a lot to help homeless support. [Interruption]\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet, please. Is this a supplementary question? Minister Jones.\nHon Shane Jones: To the Prime Minister: is the Prime Minister aware that a capital gains tax leads to complications, complexity, and administrative dead weight?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: It's not—well, it is relevant to the lead question, so I'll let the Prime Minister answer that.\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I thank the member for raising that issue, because I'm saying taxing Kiwis and their houses and their KiwiSaver accounts is not the way forward to help people with the cost of living. It's just adding cost, adding tax. On this side of the House, we believe in low taxes, we believe in backing people who want to make something happen, not taxing everybody in sight.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Question number—quiet during questions, please.\n2.: CAMERON BREWER (National—Upper Harbour) to the Minister of Finance: What is the Government's revenue strategy?\nHon SIMON WATTS (Minister of Revenue): on behalf of the Minister of Finance: A revenue strategy is required by the Public Finance Act. The current Government strategy, part of the 2025 Fiscal Strategy Report, states that a good tax system is one that, among other things, \"finances public expenditure in a fair and efficient way\", \"encourages effort and investment\", and \"has low compliance and administrative costs\". It goes on to say, \"The Government will operate a stable, predictable revenue system\", and it adds that the Government \"is committed to public engagement in the design of tax policy\".\nCameron Brewer: What does the strategy say about future revenue and expenses?\nHon SIMON WATTS: On behalf of the Minister of Finance, the strategy recognises that Government spending is currently greater than revenue, meaning the operating balance is in deficit. Revenue and spending need to be brought back into balance. Crucially, the strategy states, \"Spending restraint is the Government's primary lever for achieving these goals. With prudent control of spending, the Government does not intend to seek\"—nor does it need to seek—\"major additional sources of revenue.\" I would also note that a tax increase, announced alongside spending increases that it matches dollar for dollar, does absolutely nothing to improve the operating deficit or Government debt.\nCameron Brewer: What has the Government done to encourage effort and investment through the tax system?\nHon SIMON WATTS: On behalf of the Minister of Finance, in last year's Budget the Government increased personal income tax thresholds. These had not been adjusted in the previous 14 years, despite significant wage growth. We also increased the in-work tax credit, which helps low- and middle-income working families with children, and expanded eligibility for the independent earner tax credit. Working people in this country now get to keep more of the money that they work so hard to earn. That is reward for effort, and it is delivered within tight Budget operating allowances. An estimated 727,000 households benefit by at least $75 a fortnight, and members opposite voted against it.\nCameron Brewer: What—[Interruption]\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet during questions, please.\nCameron Brewer: What else has the Government done to encourage effort and investment through the tax system?\nHon SIMON WATTS: On behalf of the Minister of Finance, study after study has identified that, compared to other countries, New Zealand has a low level of capital investment per worker. To raise productivity, lift incomes, and drive long-term economic growth, New Zealand needs businesses, big and small, to invest in machinery, tools, equipment, technology, vehicles, industrial buildings, and other capital assets. In this year's Budget, the Government launched Investment Boost, a tax incentive for New Zealand businesses to make these sorts of capital investment. As a consequence of this policy, we expect to see a lift in New Zealand's capital stock, a lift in GDP, and a lift in wages, again delivered within tight Budget operating allowances, and again opposed by members on that side of the House.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: That answer was quite long enough. I'd like them to be a bit briefer, please.\nCameron Brewer: What sort of tax would be ruled out by the Government's revenue strategy?\nHon SIMON WATTS: Well, on behalf of the Minister of Finance, it would be one that, according to an Australian expert report—and I quote—\"is a tax which in any administrative form must be complex and difficult and produce some abnormalities and inequalities of its own. There is no doubt whatsoever that any revenue it raises could be more cheaply and easily raised in other ways.\" In addition, if that tax discouraged effort and investment, such as an investment in small-business premises, and if it gave preferential treatment to certain groups—for example, people that inherit—\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Right, I think that's a long enough answer. Thank you.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: Madam Speaker?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Sorry, is this a supplementary or a point of order?\nRt Hon Winston Peters: It's a supplementary, because this is supplementary time. Can I ask the Minister: looking around the world, is there any comparative equality in terms of the policy advocated by the Labour Party when it comes to the question of capital gains tax? Is there any example, anywhere in the world—\n: Hon Willie Jackson: What a dumb question.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: No, it's only dumb if you don't understand tax.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet during questions, please.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: This is not mirror time for Willie; this is time when you pay attention.\n: Hon Willie Jackson: Oh, get to the question.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: With the greatest respect, this guy could take some education about taxation.\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order. With respect, the question should have been ruled out by now. The minute the Minister asked his colleague for opinions on a Labour Party policy, that was out of order.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: The reason the question hasn't been ruled out by now is that there is a lot of noise coming during supplementary questions. I'd like the Rt Hon Winston Peters to ask that question again, without referring to the Opposition, and ask the question straight to the Minister, and the Opposition will be quiet.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: Having heard of a recent example of a limited capital gains tax, is there anywhere in the world where an economy has adopted that policy?\nHon SIMON WATTS: On behalf of the Minister of Finance, what I am clear about—and I'm not aware of other countries in the world that are looking to punish their citizens for success through taxation—\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No—[Interruption] That's not an answer. Sit down, please.\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order. Madam Speaker, you made it extremely clear to the member asking the question that it was not to be in reference to any other party's policy. The Minister then, in response, completely ignored your clear guidance.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: I cut the Minister off and asked him to sit down, because I could see what was happening there—\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: He didn't, though, did he?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, he did. I said, \"That's enough—finish off the answer,\" and I asked him to sit down.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: With respect to tax policy, has the Minister heard the statement \"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen\"?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, that's not a question, thank you. We're going to move on to question No. 3.\n3.: CHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green) to the Prime Minister: E tautoko ana ia i ngā kōrero me ngā mahi katoa a tōna Kāwanatanga?\n: [Does he stand by all of his Government's statements and actions?]\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON (Prime Minister): Yes.\nChlöe Swarbrick: What is the effective tax rate paid by the wealthiest 1 percent of New Zealanders, and why is it half the effective tax rate of the average hard-working New Zealander?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: We have a progressive income tax system in New Zealand, and the more money you earn, the more tax you pay.\nChlöe Swarbrick: How is it fair that hard-working New Zealanders pay tax on every dollar they earn through income while the super wealthy passively accumulate more and more untaxed wealth without lifting a finger?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, in answer to the member's first leg to that question: it's somewhat ironic, because she and her party did not support basic tax relief for low- and middle-income working New Zealanders. It wasn't ideological; it was a pretty simple up and down vote: do you lift the tax thresholds for low- and middle-income working New Zealanders? Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori all said no, because you do not care about working New Zealanders—period.\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order, Madam Speaker. Speakers' rulings are quite clear that no Minister should bring parties that aren't involved in the question into the fray, and that Minister—the Prime Minister—does it repeatedly and has been told by other presiding officers not to do it.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yep, thank you. I'd ask the Prime Minister to refrain from doing it for the rest of the day.\nChlöe Swarbrick: Why does he think that, in the past three years, the average net worth of the wealthiest 20 percent in this country grew by 20 percent while the poorest 20 percent got poorer by 9 percent if not economic rules that are geared towards the benefit of the wealthiest?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: You asked me why—because there was something called a Labour-Greens Government—\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No—[Interruption] I'd ask the member to ask that question again. That was a swing at the Opposition, and it wasn't an answer to the question.\n: Hon David Seymour: Point of order! Madam Speaker, the member asked a question about a period of time during which, as the Prime Minister says, there was a Labour-Greens Government. I don't see how that's not a legitimate response to the question.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: I'm asking the member to ask the question again, please.\nChlöe Swarbrick: Why does the Prime Minister think that, in the past three years, the average net wealth of the wealthiest 20 percent grew by 20 percent while the poorest 20 percent in this country got 9 percent poorer if not because of an economic system that is geared to benefit the wealthy?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, because when a Government increases spending by 84 percent, and it drives up inflation to 7.3 percent, that then leads to higher interest rates—they went up 12 times—high interest rates puts an economy into recession, and people lose their jobs. The consequence of all of that is that working and middle-income New Zealanders got incredibly hurt and damaged.\nChlöe Swarbrick: So when does he expect his tax cuts and Public Service cuts to trickle down?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, the good news is that the economy is growing now in this quarter. We have job ads up. We have building consents up. We have exports up. We have interest rates down. We have inflation down. We have business confidence up eight points. We have farmer confidence at a good level. We've got Accor building hotels now—their 49th, going on to their 50th. We've got Port of Auckland and Freightways talking about good activity. Loan arrears are down. They're all positive signs.\nChlöe Swarbrick: What is more important to the Prime Minister: allowing the wealthiest to amass hundreds of millions in untaxed wealth or properly funding our hospitals, our schools, our emergency services, and our infrastructure?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I'm actually very proud that this is a Government that realised about $40 billion of inefficiency, deployed it to the front line, including almost $17 billion in healthcare in our first Budget and a further increase of 6 to 7 percent in our second Budget.\nHon Shane Jones: On the matter of Government actions, can the Prime Minister confirm that, by exempting a substantial number of companies from the onerous obligation of reporting mythical climate emissions, our economy will be better off for it?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Anything that lowers compliance and regulation and red tape and green tape is a good thing for New Zealand because we've got to get the show unblocked and get it moving. Again, I'd just say to the Opposition party, support our fast-track legislation and mining.\nChlöe Swarbrick: Does the Prime Minister agree with the assertion from his Minister, just then, that climate emissions are \"mythical\"?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: He didn't make that assertion. He said climate reporting, that is adding huge amounts of cost and compliance to businesses, is a waste of time.\n: Chlöe Swarbrick: Point of order, Madam Speaker. We have demonstrable evidence, almost immediately, that the Minister said precisely that.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, I do believe that the Minister did use the word \"mythical\" in his question—about climate reporting, though, wasn't it? It was about climate reporting, right?\n: Chlöe Swarbrick: Madam Speaker, if I recall correctly, it was about reporting on \"mythical climate emissions\".\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Ok. So—\n: Hon Shane Jones: Speaking to the point of order! The mythology refers to the beliefs of the party across the road. They are the ones who introduced that policy. It is mythical because it's disappeared.\n: Chlöe Swarbrick: Speaking to the point of order!\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Sorry, is this a point of order or a question?\n: Chlöe Swarbrick: I'm speaking to the point of order, in which I asked the Prime Minister a very straightforward question, whether he agreed with the assertion from one of his Ministers about whether climate changing emissions were mythical or not.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: And the Minister just clarified that the policy was now mythical because the policy was no longer in place. So, we've—\n: Chlöe Swarbrick: Madam Speaker!\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: —so we've clarified that. No, is this a new question?\n: Chlöe Swarbrick: I guess I just have a question for the House about whether the truth matters anymore.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, this—[Interruption] OK. Order, please! Yes, the truth does matter, and we're going to move on to question— [Interruption] Quiet, please!\n: Rt Hon Winston Peters: Point of order. Madam Speaker, the last question is utterly offensive to this House. It's not within Standing Order or Speakers' rulings, or any other procedure of the past—\n: Ricardo Menéndez March: You would know!\n: Rt Hon Winston Peters:  Of course, I'd know! Far more than you, sunshine! And that's why I'm raising this point of order. That member should be required to stand now and apologise to the House.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No. No, we're moving on.\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: I had to tell the Opposition to be quiet during questions before, and now I'm going to tell the Government members to be quiet during questions.\n4.: Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana) to the Minister of Finance: Does she stand by her statement of July 2024 that \"cost of living relief is on its way\"; if so, why?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Finance): on behalf of the Minister of Finance: Yes. The reason why is that the statement was made two days before personal income tax changes came into effect on 31 July 2024. The member might be aware that the next sentence goes on to say, \"From Wednesday, [you'll] be able to keep more of your hard-earned money to put towards things that are important to you, your children, your weekly shop, [and] paying your power bill.\" Those changes, mostly to income tax thresholds and the in-work tax credit, made around 1.9 million New Zealand households better off, on average, by $60 a fortnight. Households with children were better off, on average, by $78 a fortnight. And it is strange that the member would ask about that particular quote, in this particular week, because there is now a clear choice between a Government that wants to spend carefully, reduce your tax burden, and let you succeed on your own terms, and an Opposition that wants to put their hands in your pocket with a creepy and creeping capital gains tax.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: How many families, therefore, lost money because of the tax changes which came into effect on the date the Minister just reported?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, the tax threshold increase meant that people were liable to pay less tax. So if there was any group that somehow paid more, then I guess you would point to them. But 1.9 million households were better off.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: How many families have received the full $250 tax cut that was promised by this Government?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: The fact is that that promise is a sliding scale: it is a range of relief that might be received. And the Opposition can spend as much time as they like pointing out that rather obvious fact, but the people back at home want to see a Government that spends their money as carefully as the people in it would spend their own, and is able to reduce taxes rather than putting new taxes in front of them that will take all sorts of things that they might not have expected, because they can't trust \"Chippy\".\nHon Barbara Edmonds: If the cost of living relief is on its way, why are KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals the highest they have been, more than double what it was this time two years ago?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, the voters, I believe, have a lot more intelligence than they're sometimes given credit for by the Opposition. They can see that the conditions New Zealanders face in the economy today are caused by a combination of factors overseas, historic policies by the New Zealand Government, and the initiatives of the current Government. And when they look at the current Government, they see a Government that is carefully managing its spending, that is presiding over falling inflation and falling interest rates so that New Zealanders have more money in their pocket left at the end of the week. The voters can work it out; if only those people could.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: Are families getting more, when 5,530 people made KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals in the month of September?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: It is clear that there are people having a tough time, and we feel for people that are in the position—\n: Hon Ginny Andersen: Do you? Really?\nHon DAVID: SEYMOUR: —of drawing on their KiwiSaver. I'd just say to Ginny Andersen, who says, \"Do you? Really?\", actually, yes.\n: Hon Ginny Andersen: I don't think you do.\nHon DAVID: SEYMOUR: When a person answers a question in the House—oh, Madam Speaker, point of order. She's just said, \"I don't think you do.\" Now, to say that a member is deliberately misleading the House—\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think that—\nHon DAVID: SEYMOUR: —is a breach of order, and she—\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: That was an interjection going both ways, so carry on with the answer.\nHon DAVID: SEYMOUR: Well, no, I'm sorry, Madam Speaker, it is a breach of the Standing Orders to accuse another member of lying. She did it twice and repeatedly—\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No. No—\nHon DAVID: SEYMOUR: —and she should be asked to withdraw and apologise.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, the member didn't accuse the Minister of lying; she just said she thought he didn't understand.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: Who else is there to blame for her economic mismanagement, given her Government has blamed Labour, power companies, Fonterra, insurance companies, supermarkets, US tariffs, \"merchants of misery\", teenagers, John Key, teachers, firefighters, doctors, nurses, local councils, and unions?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, there was a man once who was called Christian Cullen, and he was known for being fast on his feet. Barbara Edmonds is the opposite of Christian Cullen. She stomps through question time with her lead shoes, reading out the questions that had been written down before, not changing tack when anything else changes in question time. As I said in a previous answer, the voters have a lot more intelligence and perspective than they are given credit for by the Opposition. They can appreciate that a combination of historic Government policy, of events that have occurred overseas, and the current Government's actions influence the conditions they face. And the current Government's actions are to spend money carefully, to take pressure off inflation, to see interest rates coming down, to cut red tape, and to improve the prospects of New Zealanders. They can see that this Government is fixing what matters for them; these guys are out of touch\nHon Paul Goldsmith: Does she stand by her statement that the Labour capital gains tax plan is a \"terrible idea\"?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: That's not related to the original question, thank you. Question No. 5—[Interruption] Quiet, please. Quiet!\n5.: CAMERON LUXTON (ACT) to the Minister for Biosecurity: What recent announcements has he made about strengthening the biosecurity system?\nHon ANDREW HOGGARD (Minister for Biosecurity): Last week, I announced the Government's plan for overhauling the Biosecurity Act, to safeguard New Zealand's primary sector into the future. As an island, food-producing nation, our prosperity relies on protection from biosecurity threats. New Zealand exports $60 billion of food and fibre products each year, and our relative freedom from pests and diseases is a big part of our competitive advantage and underpins our primary sector. That's why we're modernising the Biosecurity Act with nearly 50 proposals for change that will strengthen protection against invasive pests and diseases.\nCameron Luxton: How could an invasive species or a disease that impacts animals have such a big impact on our economy?\n: Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Oh, he's really kicking the hornets' nest now.\nHon ANDREW HOGGARD: Yes, we'll take care of them. The primary sector really is the backbone of our economy, but we cannot afford to be complacent. Diseases and invasive species can spread fast and wipe out entire sectors if they are not prevented at the border or detected early and managed properly. Economic analysis from the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) says a foot-and-mouth incursion would cost over $14 billion a year. That wouldn't just cost farmers; it would shut down our economy and permanently damage our international reputation and credibility. Our biosecurity system is strong, and we're committed to maintaining a strong border and robust biosecurity systems.\nCameron Luxton: How will the biosecurity system at the border be strengthened?\nHon ANDREW HOGGARD: One of the things we will be doing is to introduce a new offence for not declaring high-risk goods, such as raw meat, at the border. This offence will attract a fine of $800, while low-risk goods not declared will stay at $400. Our relative freedom from pests and diseases is greatly valued by all Kiwis, and this will remind visitors that New Zealand takes biosecurity seriously. We cannot afford to put our primary sector and our natural environment at risk, and the best way to manage any biosecurity incursion is to stop it from happening in the first place.\nCameron Luxton: What changes have been made to import health standards?\nHon ANDREW HOGGARD: We're improving New Zealand's import rules by making the development of import health standards more flexible and allowing risk assessments to be tailored to the scenario—for example, we will enable the ability to issue a one-off permit for goods where it wouldn't make sense to develop and maintain an import health standard. These changes are in addition to a new programme of work I announced this year, aimed at significantly reducing the time it takes to develop an import health standard. This will enable higher volumes of trade and, thus, give exporters greater access to new materials to develop innovative products without lowering our biosecurity standards.\nHon Shane Jones: On the matter of pests, can the Minister confirm: what is the status of the invasive Portuguese millipede—otherwise known as Ommatoiulus moreleti—and whether or not it has crept across to the other side of the House?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Does the Minister wish to answer the first part of this question? I have no understanding of what that species is.\nHon ANDREW HOGGARD: I believe in terms of where you've got a pest at a regional level, the regional council does take precedence. But yes, we will be looking to equip biosecurity with lots of flamethrowers, to try and remove that and spiders.\n6.: SAM UFFINDELL (National—Tauranga) to the Minister of Health: What actions is the Government taking to increase vaccination rates?\nHon SIMEON BROWN (Minister of Health): Our Government is taking the current measles outbreak very seriously. Cases are now confirmed across multiple regions, and the risk of continued transmission is high. That's why, this week, Health New Zealand launched a nationwide Measles Immunisation Week, to highlight the need for Kiwis to get immunised. Measles is a serious disease. In the 2019 outbreak, one in three people who contracted measles needed hospital care. That's why Health New Zealand is running pop-up clinics, tracing contacts, and supporting families to lift our vaccination coverage—to stamp out the measles outbreak and to prevent the wider impacts of this disease on our schools, our health system, society, and the economy.\nSam Uffindell: What steps has the Government taken to reduce the impact of serious diseases, like measles?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: We have reinstated the health target for immunisation. After years of decline, our latest quarterly health target results show that 82 percent of children were now fully immunised by age two, up from 76.5 percent at 30 June last year, representing the largest annual gain across all of our health targets. This shows that our focus on targets is working. Whilst this is a significant increase, though, there is still much more work to be done. Health New Zealand is working with providers to make it easier for people to get their MMR vaccines and other vaccines, including through extra and pop-up clinics, to prevent the outbreak from worsening.\nSam Uffindell: Why is it important to increase the MMR vaccination rate?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: Measles is one of the most infectious viruses in the world. One case can infect 12 to 18 unvaccinated people. If you're not immunised and you're exposed, there's a 90 percent chance that you will catch it. Vaccination is the single best way to protect families, prevent community spread, and take pressure off our hospitals, with two doses of the MMR vaccine providing about 99 percent protection. We need around 95 percent coverage to stop future outbreaks and to stamp out the current incursion. Over the last few years, rates fell; we are now turning that around, but there's still more work to do.\nSam Uffindell: Why did the Government reintroduce the immunisation target?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: Let's be clear: we're committed to giving every child the healthiest possible start to life. Targets matter because, ultimately, that helps to drive the system to ensure that we can reach the targets needed to prevent outbreaks such as what we are experiencing today. It also ensures that children get the protection they need when they need it. Whilst New Zealand's overall vaccination rates have improved, there is still much more work to do. That's why Health New Zealand is working with providers this week and all weeks—particularly this week with the Measles Immunisation Week—to drive up immunisation rates and to promote the need for immunisation so that we can act decisively to prevent this outbreak from spreading.\nHon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Is it correct that despite his Government's performance against the target, the number of susceptible people is estimated to increase by a thousand a month and, therefore, the risk of an outbreak continues to grow irrespective of the target?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: I would say to that member that it is critically important that we focus on improving immunisation rates. I would point out what happened to immunisation rates under the previous six years, under the Labour Government, where they fell from around 92 percent of two-year-olds to around 75 percent of two-year-olds, due to the removal of the target. We have reintroduced the target. We are now focused on meeting it. We acknowledge that there's a lot more work to do, and we're focused on doing it.\nHon David Seymour: What approach is the Government taking to school attendance in the course of this outbreak, particularly during NCEA exams, and what advice has the director-general issued to schools, in relation to attendance and the outbreak?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: The Director-General of Health has provided very clear advice that school students should continue to attend schools and exams, unless they are identified as a close contact and aren't immunised. It's about making sure that we continue to get our children the education that they need. Ultimately, though, the very clear message is that whether it's teachers or students, immunisation is the best protection against measles, and we're encouraging everyone to take up that opportunity to get immunised. The latest data which I have just received shows that there was around 2,500 measles immunisations delivered yesterday—the highest number since 2019.\n7.: CHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green) to the Prime Minister: E tautoko ana ia i ngā kōrero me ngā mahi katoa a tōna Kāwanatanga?\n: [Does he stand by all of his Government's statements and actions?]\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON (Prime Minister): Yes.\nChlöe Swarbrick: Does the Prime Minister stand by his answer to the Greens in question time, December 2023, when he said, and I quote, \"We're not weakening our actions on climate change, we're just going about it in a different way.\", when his Government has just announced weakening our methane targets by halving them?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I think we've been very clear about our position on methane targets. We have the best farmers in the world. We have the most carbon-efficient farmers in the world. The madness of the previous administration of sending production offshore to less carbon- and production-efficient countries makes global greenhouse gas emissions worse. We want to maintain our delivery of our commitments that we have. [Interruption]\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet during questions, please.\nChlöe Swarbrick: Does the Prime Minister understand that Government policy which increases climate-changing emissions will ultimately increase New Zealanders' cost of living?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: We're not going to drive our farmers offshore and shut down farming production in New Zealand. We are not here to punish our farmers. They are the best in the world. They are the most carbon efficient in the world and we back them to succeed out there in the real world.\nChlöe Swarbrick: Is the Prime Minister aware that for every Government action that increases emissions, we become more liable to pay billions of dollars offshore for other countries to reduce their emissions?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I'm not punishing New Zealand farmers in any stretch of the imagination. These are the farmers that get up early each and every day. This is the farming sector that's pulling New Zealand out of the recession that the Labour-Greens Government created. We are backing our farmers. We are not punishing our farmers. They do an outstanding job and we've got the right policy to help them.\n: Chlöe Swarbrick: Point of order. The question was specifically about our constructive liabilities under the Paris Agreement, which the Prime Minister should understand, and the fact that if we are not reducing our climate-changing emissions domestically, then we have liability to pay other countries to do that. He did not even address the question.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Does the Prime Minister want to expand, please, on the liability part of that question?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: This is a Government that is doing everything it can to meet its climate obligations, including Net Zero 2050, and, based off our latest emissions reduction plan, there's a possibility we may even do it earlier.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: Prime Minister, when you were answering that question, were you giving the answer to the Māori version or the English translation version, given that the latter is not an accurate translation of the former?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, can I just be unambiguous in either te reo or English that we are backing farmers, our policy is the right one, we're going to make sure that we deliver on our commitments, but importantly, we are powering up this economy and we are all about economic growth.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: I actually think that that wasn't an actual question. The translation is not the Prime Minister's responsibility; it's part of the question.\n: Hon Shane Jones: Supplementary question?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is this a supplementary to question No. 7?\n: Hon Shane Jones: Yes. A question to the Prime Minister: is he aware that one of the most wealthiest men in New Zealand has abandoned the hyperbole and hysteria of climate change, in the form of Bill Gates?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: What I'm aware of is that if you want to back climate change, you would support fast-track legislation, you'd support mining for critical earth minerals, you would support ending the oil and gas ban because, actually, that's what's needed in this country.\n: Rt Hon Winston Peters: Point of order. Madam Speaker, the translation may be not the Prime Minister's role or responsibility, but I asked the question as to what he was answering, the Māori version or the English version, and you thought that you'd dismiss it by saying, \"Well, we all know that's not his responsibility.\" So let's have this question: why aren't you fulfilling your responsibility, and your staff, and getting it right in the first place?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, I'm not accepting that point of order. This is a translated question which has been on notice for today and it's on the translation on various other days. The Prime Minister is well aware of what the question means and I'm moving on to question No. 8.\n8.: Hon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour) to the Minister of Health: Does he stand by his statement that \"We want all New Zealanders to be able to see a GP when they need one\"; if so, is it acceptable that almost one in six New Zealanders cannot afford to go to the doctor?\nHon SIMEON BROWN (Minister of Health): In the context it was made, yes. Our Government is committed to ensuring that all New Zealanders can access the care they need when they need it. To do this, we have delivered the biggest ever funding boost for GPs—$175 million this year alone—and allowed a fee increase of just 3 percent, keeping costs stable and predictable. We know that the biggest barrier for patients today is actually getting an appointment. In 2023-24, 25.7 percent of adults couldn't see a GP due to wait times, up from 11.6 percent in 2021-22. That is why we are focused on affordability and accessibility. We're extending prescriptions to 12 months where safe, saving patients up to $105 a year in GP fees; strengthening the primary care workforce; launching a 24/7 online GP care service for times when patients can't see their regular GP; and we continue to target support through subsidised GP visits for community services card holders, and the Very Low Cost Access scheme. All of this is about putting patients first and making sure that every Kiwi can get in to see a doctor when they need to.\nHon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Will he help the tradie who said to me, \"I don't go to the doctor's, because I can't afford to; I earn $24 an hour.\"; or is he not bothered by the fact that cost is preventing working people from seeing the doctor?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: Well, as the member will be aware, there is the community services card scheme, which means that those people earning that amount of money are able to pay a maximum of $20 co-payment. Ultimately, that member's policy is to put a capital gains tax on property, on commercial buildings, and on KiwiSaver so that people earning high incomes can go to the doctor for free.\nHon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Does he recognise that the cost of doctors visits is harming patients, like the woman who wrote to me that she self-treated her joint problem with anti-inflammatories because she couldn't afford a $60 visit and ended up with hearing loss?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: What I'd say to that member is that the increased number of New Zealanders who could not access a GP appointment because they couldn't get one went from 11 percent, under her watch, to 25 percent. The other point that she fails to actually mention is that the cost of GP fees went up by 30 percent under Labour. We're focused on increasing accessibility and affordability, such as our policy of extending prescriptions, saving people with long-term conditions $105. I have not heard from the Labour Party whether they actually support that policy.\nHon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Is it fair that, under his Government, a woman with pneumonia has to chose between her own health and that of her diabetic husband because they can't both afford to go to the doctor?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: As I said earlier, the cost of seeing a GP went up 30 percent under the Labour Party's watch. We're focused on improving accessibility and focused on improving affordability with policies such as extending prescriptions to 12 months. I am yet to hear from the Labour Party as to whether or not they support our policy of extending prescriptions up to 12 months. That would save people up to $105 per year in seeing a GP. I have not heard from the Labour Party whether or not they support that policy.\nHon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Is the 70-year-old grandmother with asthma, diabetes, and high blood pressure, who has cancelled her last three doctors appointments because she can't afford it because of the $75 fee, getting the care she needs?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: Patients with asthma, such as that grandmother, and such as me, require long-term prescriptions, and our policy will mean they won't have to get repeat prescriptions, costing $105 per year, and they will be able to get a 12-month prescription. I am yet to hear whether or not the Labour Party supports that policy.\n9.: SUZE REDMAYNE (National—Rangitīkei) to the Minister for Tourism and Hospitality: What recent announcements has she made to support tourism in New Zealand?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON (Minister for Tourism and Hospitality): Recently, I've made two joint announcements that will bring more visitors to New Zealand and boost our economy. Over the weekend, Minister Potaka and I announced $10.8 million of funding to complete two sections on the Mountains to Sea great ride. These sections are among the last needed to complete the full trail from Mount Ruapehu to the Tasman Sea. Minister Stanford and I also announced that, as of yesterday, Chinese visitors are now able to travel visa-free from Australia to New Zealand. Tourism is a key part of our Government's plan to grow the economy, and these announcements will help do just that.\nCarl Bates: How will the cycle trail announcement support the regions?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON: We know the benefits a thriving tourism and hospitality sector brings to our economy, supporting local regions and communities. Ready-to-go projects like the cycle trails will bring more visitors to the Ruapehu region and entice them to stay longer and boost the central North Island economy. Overseas tourists coming to New Zealand remain a key driver of regional growth, and we want them to experience our great rides. Our Government is fully committed to supporting the regions to thrive, including getting more visitors to every corner of New Zealand.\nSuze Redmayne: Why are Chinese visitors important to New Zealand's tourism market?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON: China is New Zealand's largest trading partner and our third largest source of international visitors. In the last year alone, we welcomed almost 250,000 Chinese visitors to our land. We also know that over 60 million Chinese travellers are actively considering a visit to New Zealand, and China will play a pivotal role in doubling New Zealand's exports over the next 10 years. We're committed to welcoming more Chinese visitors to New Zealand and strengthening the ties between our two countries.\nSuze Redmayne: How will more international visitors support economic growth?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON: By investing in tourism, we are creating opportunities for growth, as tourism supports one in 10 jobs in New Zealand and contributes $44 billion to our economy. Every time a tourist comes to New Zealand and spends money in a local shop, buys food in a local restaurant or cafe, and stays in our accommodation, it's good for jobs, it's great for growth, and it's great for the incomes of New Zealanders. Our message is clear: New Zealand is open for business, and we welcome visitors anytime, anywhere, from any place.\n10.: Hon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour) to the Minister for Social Development and Employment: Does she agree with the Prime Minister's statement regarding employment, \"They do have jobs. Often what happens is the people will take a job, they don't stick with it for longer than a couple of days, they don't show up on time\"; if not, why not?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON (Minister for Social Development and Employment): Yes, I do agree with the Prime Minister's comments that he made about young people. We know young people may need more support and training to be job ready. We have already made the welfare system more active and brought back rights and responsibilities with the traffic light system to help people stay on track. We are encouraging New Zealanders to be ready for work while also backing employers who need committed staff to grow their businesses and our economy.\nHon Ginny Andersen: Would the people of Tokoroa have more jobs right now if they had followed the Prime Minister's advice and stuck with a job longer than a couple of days and showed up on time?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON: On behalf of the people of Tokoroa, I find that member's comments offensive. I know the local MP has spent time with them on Friday, supporting the community with job opportunities, with recruitment agencies, with on-the-ground support from the Ministry of Social Development and community organisations, and I find that member's comments offensive.\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order!\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: I've got a point of order from Kieran McAnulty, and we may be thinking the same thing, but make your point of order.\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: Madam Speaker, if a member finds a comment offensive, then the person who made it should be made to withdraw or apologise. In this instance, the person who made those comments is the Prime Minister; he should be made to withdraw and apologise.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, I think—\n: Hon Louise Upston: Speaking to the point of order!\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Speaking to the point of order, I think the member was referring to the comments of—\n: Hon Louise Upston: I was, and speaking to the point of order, that member is speaking about a quote that has nothing to do with Tokoroa, and he might want to check his facts before raising it.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: I'm going to say that I did not find the member's statement, or question, offensive to the people of Tokoroa. I took it more that there have been some job losses over there, and the member may wish to clarify that, because it didn't sound offensive to me.\n: Hon Ginny Andersen: Speaking to the point of order, the comment was made about young people. There are young people in Tokoroa who no longer have employment, and I wanted to know whether that related to them or not.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: OK, thank you. You can ask the next question.\nHon Ginny Andersen: Does she agree with the local people of Tokoroa who said that cutting their trade training capabilities right after so many job losses is just another kick in the guts; if not, why?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON: I would really encourage the member to get her facts straight. In terms of the Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology, the Minister responsible for vocational education has ensured that there is additional funding available for Toi Ohomai, both for the Tokoroa campus and for the Taupō campus, to ensure that training is available on the ground.\nHon Ginny Andersen: Why then did her Government force Toi Ohomai to cut jobs in trade training right after record job losses in the very same region?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON: I think the member is confusing a number of things, and as I said, she might want to get her facts straight about Toi Ohomai in the centre of the North Island and the campuses in Tokoroa and Taupō. The member of Parliament for Taupō has worked incredibly closely with the council and with businesses on the ground to ensure that there is training available. What I don't think is particularly helpful, in this House, is to bring in the lives of a challenged group of locals who have lost their jobs recently. I feel for them and their families, and I don't believe it is suitable for that member to be dragging them into this House with issues that are actually factually incorrect.\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: I believe the member's asking questions on their behalf, rather than targeting her questions at them.\nHon Ginny Andersen: Does she agree with the Prime Minister's statement that employers in the Hawke's Bay are \"crying out\" for young people; if so, why are there 7,359 job seekers but only 568 advertised jobs in the Hawke's Bay?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON: I would like to just encourage that member to realise that we are seeing some really positive signs. If you look at the increase recently in the online job advertisements, it shows that there are increased opportunities in construction and hospitality, of which there are jobs in the Hawke's Bay. I would encourage members to look at where there are positive opportunities, instead of doubling down on those who have challenges.\nHon Todd McClay: Has the Minister seen media reports over the hard work of the member of Parliament for Taupō in working to ensure that Toi Ohomai's campuses in Taupō and also in Tokoroa remain open and that they were facing significant changes that would have led to a lack of training locally in those communities, as a result of the significant wasteful spending of the last Government and a wasteful reorganisation?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON: Yes, I have seen reports of the work that the local member of Parliament has been doing on the ground with stakeholders, with the council, with Toi Ohomai, with the unions, with the community organisations, with other training providers, and with other polytechs—\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: And that's a long enough answer.\n: Rawiri Waititi: Point of order, Madam Speaker. Was she answering that question with the Pākehā translation of \"Taupo\" or with the Māori translation of Taupō?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: She was saying it in her form of pronunciation.\nHon Ginny Andersen: How can she agree with the Prime Minister and say that there are jobs available, when 600 people applied for one casual job at mini-putt golf in this region?\nHon LOUISE UPSTON: As I said, there is positive annual growth, and it's up 10 percent for the construction industry, 10.2 percent for the IT industry, 6.8 percent for the hospitality industry, and 2.9 percent for the primary industries. We should be positive. We should be looking forward, as well as the 240,000 jobs that are coming over the next couple of years because of this Government's investment in infrastructure and this Government's work to unleash businesses by getting rid of red and green tape.\n11.: PAULO GARCIA (National—New Lynn) to the Minister for Trade and Investment: What has the Government recently announced about strengthening trade and economic ties with Singapore and Chile?\nHon TODD: McCLAY (Minister for Trade and Investment): Just last Friday, at APEC in Korea, along with the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Singapore, and the President of Chile, we launched negotiations for the Green Economy Partnership Agreement, or GEPA. This will be a high-quality agreement that boosts trade and investment between our countries and will drive economic growth in New Zealand. This agreement will position New Zealand businesses at the forefront of the growing global green economy, which is expected to be valued at $19 trillion by 2040.\nPaulo Garcia: What are the key pillars of the Green Economy Partnership Agreement?\nHon TODD: McCLAY: The GEPA, as it's called, will cover many innovative areas, including sustainable finance and investment, green goods and services, sustainable agricultural food systems, and low-emissions fuel alternatives. It aims to bring down barriers, lower costs, and reduce tariff rates across the green economy, and, once completed, it will be open to other countries to join. Our shared vision for the GEPA is to support new trade opportunities and efficiencies for businesses, reinforce the rules-based order of international trade, and lower trade barriers while achieving climate change action.\nPaulo Garcia: How does trade and investment support sustainable growth?\nHon TODD: McCLAY: Well, the Government believes that solutions to environmental challenges, including climate change, will come from greater trade and cooperation with other countries, not less, and through investment in new technologies, not putting up costs on businesses or putting them out of business. The GEPA will drive investment in innovation and trade with Singapore and Chile and, in turn, will mean more exports and more investment for higher-paying jobs for New Zealanders.\nPaulo Garcia: What other agreements has the Government announced with Singapore and Chile?\nHon TODD: McCLAY: Well, successive Governments have worked away with these two countries. New Zealand, Singapore, and Chile have a proud history of shared leadership in developing innovative trade agreements to drive innovation and economic growth—from the P4 agreement, which went on to be the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, to, then, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, and, more recently, the New Zealand - Singapore Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which was agreed with Singapore and had been worked on for some time. All of these agreements have benefited New Zealand exporters, and this is why the Government is committed to doubling the value of exports over 10 years through agreements like the GEPA.\n12.: RAWIRI WAITITI (Co-Leader—Te Pāti Māori) to the Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON (Prime Minister): Yes.\nRawiri Waititi: Why has his Government chosen to punish success by defunding Māori health infrastructure that saved lives and performed better than many State services during the pandemic in regard to vaccination?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Because this Government is determined to lift health outcomes for Māori, and the way to do that is to focus on lifting immunisation rates for under-twos. I would just love that member to come out and have a policy idea on doing exactly that.\nRawiri Waititi: If those vaccination rates are to increase, why have Māori vaccination rates plummeted, and what is his Government going to do about it?\nCAMERON LUXTON: Well, this Government, in the very first few weeks, partnered with Māori health organisations, I think, from memory, to the tune of about $50  million. It has achieved really outstanding and excellent results, not just with Māori kids getting immunised but non-Māori kids as well.\nRawiri Waititi: Does the Prime Minister believe that teaching our children about Te Tiriti is the foundation of a bicultural nation?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, we are. But what we believe is the number one priority is, actually, academic achievement and teaching our kids the basics brilliantly, whether they're Māori or non-Māori. This is a Government that has done more in two years, with an outstanding Minister, than the previous Ministers did in the previous six.\nRawiri Waititi: Is he going to ban visits not just to marae but churches, museums, and mosques also—when does this Government's intrusion on where our children can learn and visit end?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: I'm confused by the question, as to the relevance of the question, but what is unambiguous is this is a Government that is focused on lifting Māori academic achievement. It would be fantastic if that member and his party had any ideas and any policy contribution to that. We have done more to lift Māori educational outcomes than the previous six years. Let me give you an example: Māori new entrants are operating at or above expectations on the phonics checks 20 weeks into schooling life—it's up 18 percent. Māori kids actually needing targeted extra support is down 15 percent, because we are teaching the basics brilliantly and we make no apologies for doing so.\nHon Shane Jones: On the matter of statements and actions, is the Prime Minister aware that the term \"wehewehe kāinga\" means splits and divisions lead both to doom and a political tomb?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Prime Minister doesn't have any responsibility for that question.\nHon David Seymour: Is the Prime Minister proud of the Government's—[Interruption]\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet, we're having a question.\n: Hon David Seymour: —charter school kura hourua policy, which has seen schools such as Te Rito in the Far North, TIPINE in South Auckland, and soon Te Aratika in Hawke's Bay open to empower Māori to learn on their terms, their way?\nRt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: I am, and there are 17 charter schools now in motion and it's important. Iwi leaders I've spoken are very supportive of charter schools—even Willie Jackson's a fan.",

        "content": "Hon DAVID SEYMOUR (Minister for Regulation): I present a legislative statement on the Regulatory Standards Bill.\n: ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): That legislative statement is published under the authority of the House and can be found on the Parliament website.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: I move, That the Regulatory Standards Bill be now read a second time.\n: This bill is a crucial piece of legislation for improving the long-term quality of regulation in our country and, ultimately, allowing New Zealanders to live longer, happier, healthier, and wealthier lives. In a nutshell, if red tape and regulation are holding New Zealanders back because politicians find it politically rewarding to tie them in red tape, then we need to make regulating less rewarding for politicians by putting more sunlight on their activities. That is how the Regulatory Standards Bill will help New Zealand get its mojo back.\n: This bill turns the explanation from politicians passing laws that restrict our freedoms from \"Because we said so\" into \"Because here is the justification, according to a set of principles.\" To the rest of my colleagues across the House: if you want to tax someone, if you want to take or impair their property, if you want to restrict their livelihood, well, you can still do it, but you'll face tough questions about the impact that those actions have on people's property rights, their freedom, and the compliance of your proposal with the rule of law. It does this by introducing principles of responsible regulation into primary legislation, with a focus on good lawmaking processes and the effect of lawmaking on existing interests and liberties.\n: When making legislation, agencies and lawmakers will have to consider the principles and be transparent about those considerations. Agencies will need to confirm that the legislation and the process for developing it has been reviewed for consistency with the principles and summarise any inconsistencies with those principles. That work will need to be published, and, where an inconsistency is identified, the responsible Minister or the maker of any secondary legislation will need to explain the reasons why.\n: Let's put that into perspective by considering some issues that matter to Kiwis and how the Regulatory Standards Bill helps us avoid such mistakes. Earthquake regulations—recently repealed, and not a day too soon—have cost Kiwis billions. Saving $8.2 billion is what will occur when we remove these earthquake standards. Too many people have suffered and had their livelihoods taken away because a Parliament and a group of politicians decided that being seen to do the right thing at a moment in time was more important than the underlying rights of New Zealanders. The warnings were there—I voted against that legislation myself—but nobody took the warnings seriously enough, and it was only nine years and billions of dollars later that we are able to start putting those valuable resources into things like car crashes and cancers that, sadly, kill so many more Kiwis.\n: I want to touch on one change that's been made to one of the principles of good regulation that has been particularly topical: the takings principle. That principle provides that \"legislation should not take or impair property without the consent of the owner unless there is good justification and fair compensation is provided.\" The inclusion of \"impairment\" is essential to the intent of the bill, which is to focus attention on the impact of legislation on existing interests and liberties as well as good lawmaking processes. When the Government is considering passing legislation that impairs property rights, the nature and extent of that impairment should be made clear, and relief should be considered. However, the committee's change clarifies that the principle is intended to address situations where there is a high degree of impairment, not simply any impairment. Therefore, a reference to \"severe impairment\" has been added, which means the principle will not be engaged when there is not a severe level of impairment.\n: The bill does not require any action to be taken or compensation to be paid; the responsible Minister can provide a statement of reasons why they consider a severe impairment to be justified, and, if not paying compensation, the reasons for that position. However, the point is that this principle will make it easier for Parliament and the public to see where property rights are being severely impaired, with the intent of helping to reduce instances where impaired property rights without compensation lead to New Zealanders being so much poorer. I look forward to the committee of the whole House stage, when we can talk about the specifics of this bill in further detail. Overall, I'm proud to be responsible for a piece of legislation that is going to bring discipline and transparency to New Zealand's lawmaking processes.\n: This bill, when enforced, is going to support the people of New Zealand by ensuring them that serious consideration is being given to legislation that impacts on their lives and livelihoods. If we're asking New Zealanders to comply with regulations in everyday life, then it's only reasonable to ensure that they're clear, consistent, and meet a certain standard. When they do not meet that standard, the public rightfully expects lawmakers to be transparent about that fact. The passing of the Regulatory Standards Bill in later stages will take us a step closer to a more principled, transparent, and accountable process for making legislation in New Zealand. It will help build confidence in the legislative process, support better outcomes for New Zealanders, and ensure that our regulatory system is fit for purpose in the 21st century.\n: I've been very interested to see how easily people have mischaracterised this bill in the debate that has ensued, and I would like to touch on two changes, or two objections, that I think are misguided. One has been the repeated assertion that, somehow, the Regulatory Standards Bill imposes restrictions on Parliament and, therefore, is undemocratic. The law is crystal clear; it's there in black and white. The purpose of this law is to promote accountability and transparency to the Parliament by the executive. This enables our democracy—it enables greater transparency.\n: Building on that misconception has been another widely shared in the public domain that, somehow, the principles are inadequate because they don't include all of the objectives that the Government might have. A Government might wish to uphold the Treaty of Waitangi; it might wish to pursue goals around equity or public health or environmental protection. The fact that those are not included as principles reflects the fact that every initiative brought to this House and every regulation made by a Government is already assumed to have a public purpose. It is already assumed to have a purpose like one of the ones that I listed. The purpose of this bill is to enable and make transparent the Government of the day, to be able to show the public, and for the public to be able to see, where that collective purpose and the pursuit of it is impairing the rights of ordinary people. It's not a surprise that it doesn't include collective goals; the purpose of the law is to show when ordinary people's rights are being impaired.\n: I'd like to thank the Finance and Expenditure Committee for its very efficient consideration of the bill. I would like to also acknowledge the changes that they have made to the Regulatory Standards Board—in my view, strengthening the bill by enhancing its independence and by saying that it will be reinforced by the Governor-General rather than the Minister for Regulation. I believe that that is going to make the Regulatory Standards Board a much more august body with more authority, and it will allow that board to further raise the quality of the consistency accountability statements. Without further ado, I thank everybody for listening, and I commend this bill to the House.\n: ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): The question is that the motion be agreed to.\nHon Dr DUNCAN WEBB (Labour—Christchurch Central): Kia orana e te Mana Whakawā. Well, here we have it: a bill that 0.7 percent of submitters supported. Here, it is hard to find a bill which fewer people are in favour of, but this National Government is the lapdog of the ACT Party in this instance, sitting there and doing the ACT Party's bidding. The real irony of that speech by David Seymour is that this bill is one of the worst in terms of regulatory quality that I have ever seen.\n: Do you know who said that? The Ministry for Regulation and the Ministry of Justice in the regulatory impact statement (RIS). They said this bill has been poorly consulted on; it hasn't got a problem that it needs to address—even if there was one, it's the wrong solution; and the Minister won't let us do our job and explore other options. That is how you make bad law, and that is what we've got here.\n: One thing that struck me about the submissions process was the long list of submitters who came in and gave really thoughtful submissions. Not people from particular perspectives, but NGOs, even Government organisations, came in and said this is a bad idea. You know who looks after our legislative quality at the moment? The Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Excellent body:  thoughtful people; hate politics. They said, \"[these] principles are novel and deeply contestable\"—in other words, this is not a straightforward bill. This is a politically charged, ideological bill.\n: What did the New Zealand Law Society say? \"It is striking that the process and content of a Bill purporting to promote good law-making and high-quality legislation should fail to meet not only the Bill's own standards, but the existing established processes for supporting good law-making.\" So it's a bad bill.\n: The New Zealand Human Rights Commission, our independent human rights body: \"The Bill embeds a narrow set of principles that prioritise individual and private interests as paramount considerations in lawmaking, effectively sidelining wider considerations of collective wellbeing\". The Human Rights Commission hates this bill.\n: Then you've got a whole lot of regional councils. The Greater Wellington Regional Council: this bill \"Will impact on local government, creating legal risks, inefficiency, complexity and increased costs\". Does that sound like good law to you?\n: I picked those quotes because they are not politically aligned. They haven't got an axe to grind. They are thoughtful people who explained why this bill is bad law. Of course, David Seymour says \"Here's my list of regulatory principles—but don't worry, you can have other things in there. You know, just because I haven't mentioned Te Tiriti o Waitangi doesn't mean it's not in there.\" That is rubbish, because what this bill does is it highlights what, in his view, are the most important principles. At the top of that hierarchy are private property rights.\n: This bill is seeking to entrench, by the back door, private property rights as a constitutional principle. In fact, the chief economist of his own Ministry for Regulation wrote a paper saying that private property rights are the most important human right not currently in our law—so we can see where it's coming from. These principles are totally selective. Private property is not a guiding light for good legislation and regulation.\n: The fact of the matter is that equal treatment—the second principle, stating that everyone should be treated equally—is shorthand for the status quo. It's shorthand for saying, \"Take the existing inequalities in our society and don't seek to address them.\" It's saying, \"Where wealth has accumulated, leave it there.\"\n: Well, on this side of the House, we believe in equity. We believe in addressing the inequities which are troubling our society. Of course, not only is it silent on the Treaty; it's silent on all kinds of other key principles. All of our international obligations—nowhere in that bill does it say we should adhere to the promises we as a nation have made in the international community, whether they be around human rights or whether they be around defence and trade.\n: Human rights. What does it say about gender? What does it say about disability? What does it say about race? It says absolutely nothing.\n: Cameron Luxton: We're not debating human rights.\nHon Dr DUNCAN: WEBB: No—the ACT Party doesn't want to debate human rights. The ACT Party is not interested in human rights. The ACT Party is interested in property rights.\n: This bill is constitutionally significant. It is about how law is made. Now, the fact of the matter is that for a constitutional bill, the process has been shocking. A constitutional bill should be careful, thoughtful, and, ideally, engaging on a cross-party basis. This has been anything but. This bill is seeking to entrench property rights into our lawmaking process by stealth, and at speed. It basically promotes private property interests over collective benefits.\n: Fundamentally, this is about looking after corporate interests—because if we think about all of those rules there, all of those impairment rules, if we try to protect our communities, if we try to reduce the use of vapes or if we try to limit alcohol advertising, all of these are impairments. Now, David Seymour would say, \"Well, you can do it; you just have to say why,\" but we know that putting sand in the gears of legislation makes things least likely to happen, and that's what he wants to do. He wants to tilt the playing field in favour of corporate interests.\n: Look, even the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment came along—not known as a great supporter of the left, but he came along—and he had a lot to say. The most important thing he had to say is this: this bill puts the environment at risk, because nowhere does the environment feature. So when your bureaucrats are doing their bureaucratic job, and all of this new blue tape and yellow tape that David Seymour's creating—as they're running through their checklist, where does it say, \"How does this impact climate change?\" \"How does this impact biodiversity?\" \"How does this impact sustainability?\" It doesn't say it anywhere, because at the heart of this bill is putting property and private interests over community environment and sustainability.\n: The bill, also, is just a failure. It's an absolute procedural and regulatory failure. As I've said, failed its own RIS. The very thing it says we should do, which is check a bill for good process; it was examined, and they said it didn't meet good process. Probably the most important thing, if we have an issue with regulatory quality in New Zealand, the question is: what's the best way to fix it? The short answer by everyone who was asked the question is: not this. We have a whole lot of rules out there already, a whole lot of bodies—the Attorney-General, the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, the Regulations Review Committee, every select committee, and the list goes on, of quality checks that exist for legislation which aren't engaged in sufficiently already, largely because as Government ignores them and rides roughshod over them. This year, we had a situation where the scope of the question was limited. David Seymour, against all his own advice, came into this with a closed mind, poor problem definition, and a solution that was in place before the problem was identified.\n: But here's the other thing. This bill will cost a fortune. Not only will he have to set up its Regulatory Standards Board as a little pet board at a cost of probably $2 or $3 million but every Ministry will have to follow his new yellow tape—all of his rules he's put in place. How much will that cost? Well, MBIE said that department alone will have to spend 15 percent of its time following David Seymour's little rules at a cost of $60 million—$60 million. You can rubbish it, David Seymour, but you've seen the report, and you know it. It's a total waste of money.\n: The second thing, or the final thing, is this: this bill puts into the hands of the Regulatory Standards Board the job of questioning what we do here. That's their job, second-guessing Parliament—and for a party that talks about parliamentary sovereignty, then that lies ill in your mouth.\n: The bill is a waste of money, it doesn't meet its own standards, it's narrow, it's contested, and it's a constitutional change by itself. We will oppose this bill to the end.\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): E te Māngai, tēnā koe. Tēnā koutou e te Whare. I guess at the end of the day, the real question for this House is precisely who asked for this piece of legislation. It wasn't health experts, it wasn't the legal profession, and it definitely wasn't former Prime Ministers and those who have led former political parties. It wasn't regular New Zealanders. In fact, regular New Zealanders decided to overwhelmingly oppose this piece of legislation.\n: So if we just boil it down to the two main threads of arguments that were heard at the Finance and Expenditure Committee and have been well canvassed in the media landscape over the last few months as this Minister for Regulation has decided to push this legislation through despite the overwhelming opposition, on the one side, we've heard that it's largely redundant, that it is going to be duplicative, and, as indeed, Dr Duncan Webb alluded to, it'll be expensive. Then on the other side of the debate, at the most egregious end, we hear very clearly that what this legislation does is provide a framework for multinational corporations to be compensated by the people of this country when this Parliament decides to curtail their supposed right to destroy our shared environment, our climate, or to curb our human rights.\n: So I think again, one of those foundational questions we hear a heck of a lot from the libertarian or the supposed libertarian party in this place is about special treatment for certain demographics in our country. We have to ask ourselves: who, really, is getting special treatment in this country? So frequently we hear the Minister in charge of this legislation say that it is precisely the same communities and demographics who are disproportionately overrepresented in every single negative statistic in our society. We don't hear next to anything about the corporations who are exploiting both people and planet. In fact, they seek to pass this legislation which makes it easier for them to do precisely that exploitation.\n: I find it quite fascinating that we are indeed having this debate about how a law is made, this law being the constraints of the rules of how we are supposed to progress with making legislation into the future, and we have a situation where the Minister couldn't follow his own rules. He wants to talk about good lawmaking, yet he couldn't even uphold the processes of good lawmaking.\n: Today, the Minister of Education is removing Te Tiriti obligations from schools and saying that it is the Crown's obligation to uphold those obligations, yet we have represented in this very piece of legislation the removal and the de-prioritisation of Te Tiriti as a principle that is to be considered in good lawmaking practices.\n: Which leads us to the statement from the Waitangi Tribunal, and here I quote from their urgent inquiry report none the less, that the Crown accepted that its policy development for the bill occurred without targeted engagement for Māori. The tribunal found that this was in violation of the Crown's obligation to consult with Māori in good faith and therefore violated Treaty principles of partnership and active protection.\n: Further, we hear from the likes of the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee who submitted on the first round of the design of this legislation, which I might add had approximately 25,000 submissions, which again were overwhelmingly opposed to this legislation. They said, at that point in time, that they had, \"misgivings about the capacity of this bill to offer improvements\" because they see risks with the proposals, including the risk of significant unintended consequences.\n: They then went into three key prongs: the bill is unnecessary to the extent that it restates existing constraints in the principles of good lawmaking. Secondly, the principles contained in the bill are selective and deeply contestable. Thirdly, the bill has the potential for significant constitutional impact that has not been fully explored.\n: If we are to take the Minister's arguments in good faith at just that surface level and to ignore all of the behaviour and everything else that he has said about our many communities across this country, if we are to believe that the aim here is to make good law, then surely there should have been a good lawmaking process to produce this very law which would have brought the people of this country along for that process.\n: Instead, what we have ended up with is something whereby, as the Minister would say, it's the people who are wrong. It's his own officials who are wrong. It's the legal experts who are wrong, the environmental experts, the health experts, former Prime Ministers, and the overwhelming majority of regular New Zealanders who used their time to oppose this legislation—99 percent of them—only to be ignored yet again by this Government.\n: Then we have the impartial Law Society who says, and I quote, \"As well as being the product of inadequate consultation, the content of the Bill itself runs contrary to established precepts of legislative design in various important respects. It is striking that the process and the content of the Bill purporting to promote good law-making and high-quality legislation should fail to meet not only the Bill's own standards, but the existing established processes for supporting good law-making.\"\n: Then we hear about the red tape—the red tape. Well, let's just talk for a minute about the yellow tape which the Minister's own ministry advised him he would be creating with this very piece of legislation. Firstly, the creation of the Regulatory Standards Board, which we've just heard will cost in excess of approximately $3 million of taxpayers' dollars per year. Then there are the new compliance costs with the requirements for each ministry and agency and department to create a consistency accountability statement. Then thirdly, at the conservative estimate of $60 million per year, the requirements to review existing legislation.\n: Again, I'd make the core point that if the Government genuinely wanted to engage on the point of how we make good law and improve our constitutional arrangements in this country, we're game. We'd be totally down for that, because, in fact, I think that it would be great if we could have some form of agreement about the values and the principles that guide this country. But what we instead unfortunately have represented here is a pet vanity project from one guy in one political party that has sought to pass this legislation three times and failed until it met such a poor negotiator as our current Prime Minister.\n: So on those foundational values, well, I hold the very earnest and perhaps some on the Government side might say naive view that New Zealanders actually care about each other and the planet that we live on. But those principles, well they're nowhere to be seen as far as the design of this legislation. Again, we would make the point that if the Government wanted to actually meaningfully engage on how we could go about creating these better processes, the Greens absolutely would have been the first ones sitting around the table. Unfortunately, what we have here is the entrenchment of special rights for those who currently own things.\n: As we well canvassed in question time today, this Government cares not a whisker for addressing inequality—inequality which is compounding under intentional Government decisions that have been made to push more children into poverty, to make more people homeless, to increase our climate changing emissions, and in turn the cost of living for New Zealanders, whilst also making it more difficult for our farmers to farm. Guess what! They're the ones hit first and worst by climate change. If we wanted legislation that actually addressed these issues, we could be debating that here in the Chamber today, but instead, we unfortunately have this petty, petty vanity project.\n: I'd just make the other point that you kind of can't have it both ways. On one side of things, the Government is saying, \"Don't worry. Nothing to see here. This is kind of just business as usual. This aligns with stuff that's kind of already happening and in train.\" But then on the other side we've got a Minister professing that this is a bit of a foundational shift in our constitutional arrangement. Again, I think I tend to believe the latter, because what we've seen from our Prime Minister is an inability to grasp the detail of the things that he has negotiated and put our country on the line for in order to cobble together this coalition Government.\n: I just make, in my final 30 seconds, an appeal to the New Zealand First Party. Will the New Zealand First Party please stand up? Here is an opportunity to truly put New Zealand first. One of our Amendment Papers which will be tabled at the committee of the whole House stage will be to stop non-citizens from taking complaints and seeking compensation from the Regulatory Standards Board and we look forward to New Zealand First supporting New Zealand first. We oppose this bill.\nCAMERON BREWER (National—Upper Harbour): The Regulatory Standards Bill gives effect to National's coalition agreement with ACT. As chair of the relatively collegial Finance and Expenditure Committee, we also undertook extensive consultation on these matters. We heard approximately 30 hours of oral evidence and received over 159,000 written submissions. Of course, this follows last year's departmental consultation which attracted 23,000 submissions. FEC—the Finance and Expenditure Committee—canvassed a range of views and took a relatively liberal and cross-party approach as to who we would hear from and its acceptance of submissions. Following many submitters' feedback, key amendments to this bill have seen a best-practice tightening of the board and chair's independence and separation from the Minister and Government of the day, consistent with the provisions within the Crown Entities Act. I want to congratulate the ACT Party on what has been over 20 years of advocacy and hard work. Thank you.\nHon CASEY COSTELLO (Minister of Customs): I rise on behalf of New Zealand First to speak on the Regulatory Standards Bill, second reading. New Zealand First supports this bill because it promotes open and accountable government that legislates with key principles in mind: the rule of law, efficiency and regulation, property rights, an independent judiciary, and a belief that every New Zealander is created equal before the law.\n: The bill upholds equality before the law, it promotes openness and accountability in Government, and it ensures that property holders cannot be dispossessed of their property without fair compensation, and cost-benefit analysis of legislation ensures that economic policies that will impede productivity and growth are adequately scrutinised. For these reasons, New Zealand First commends the bill to the House.\nASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): The next call is a split call.\nRAWIRI WAITITI (Co-Leader—Te: Pāti Māori): E te iwi, the Treaty principles bill tried to change the meaning and the intent of Te Tiriti o Waitangi; the Regulatory Standards Bill (RSB) erases Te Tiriti entirely from Aotearoa's democracy without even mentioning it. This bill creates a world of minimal-to-no rules in order to ensure the profitability of all things; \"all things\" means at the expense of our people, our oranga, our labour, our whenua, our moana. The bill circumvents the rights you already have, by treating those rights as rules which the Government can consider inefficient and unprofitable. E kī, e kī.\n: [Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]\n: Te Tiriti o Waitangi is the first and the last line of defence against corporate exploitation in Aotearoa. This bill and the sham select committee process to ram it through the House is proof that true democracy doesn't exist in this country. This is what the Treaty principles bill, the takutai moana amendment Act, and the removal of Treaty clauses from legislation are really about: dismantling our collective rights to allow the Atlas Network - backed foreign companies to plunder lands, water, and resources. It creates an anti - Waitangi Tribunal, giving David Seymour's unelected mates the power to review every single law that addresses systemic inequality.\n: Make no mistake, e hika mā, the Treaty principles bill was a distraction. Chris Luxon's donors only allowed him to vote against it because they knew this bill was coming next. The Regulatory Standards Bill is a direct assault on the constitutional foundations that protect all New Zealanders from exploitation.\n: For te iwi Māori, this looks like \"Your rights are now rules.\" that the Government can deregulate as they see fit, especially when these rights are held collectively—for example, as a part of the common public good, or as hapū and iwi. These rights create costs that the Government, under the Regulatory Standards Bill, can deem to be unnecessary. Our people know this and this is why 98.7 percent of New Zealanders oppose the Regulatory Standards Bill, and yet not a single recommendation provided by the people was adopted. Te Pāti Māori stand with the majority of the 156,000-plus people who made submissions against the bill because they knew what this bill means for Aotearoa.\n: For our remote and rural communities, this bill means the emergency services and authorities can make decisions about who and where to help in a crisis, based on efficiency rather than need—because it's more expensive to help everybody—and this looks like our more marginalised rural communities are being left behind.\n: For our community kai gatherers and whānau who rely on the moana as a kāpata, the bill would enable the Government to smash our fisheries even further. For example, a rule about putting cameras on boats to monitor fisheries and illegal dumping can be argued as being inefficient because it is an unnecessary cost, with no regard for our moana or our people, who depend on it.\n: What this means for our kaumātua is that this bill would enable Governments to raise the age of eligibility for our nannies and koros to access their super, or to significantly alter the scheme completely.\n: For our learning support kaimahi and their tauira, this bill would allow the Government to justify reducing Māori curriculum content that would require expertise and new staff to deliver it—an additional cost that they would be able to label as inefficient purely due to the expense rather than need. The cost of education should not cost our mokopuna the ability to be supported in our education system.\n: For our whānau rangatahi on social welfare, right now, the Government is moving debt off its own balance sheet and placing the debt as an obligation on our parents, even though rangatahi are entitled to these provisions as citizens of the state.\n: These decisions were made without the RSB even being in place, and yet under the RSB, the situation could become the enforced norm.\n: For our country dealing with the cost of living crisis, without rules the supermarkets will not bring the prices of food down by themselves. Their first priority is making money for their owners—which fits the purpose of the RSB—not ensuring that people have access to kai.\n: I want to mihi to the 156,879 people who made powerful submissions in the resistance to this racist bill, the multitudes of people who donate their time, their expertise, and their aroha to fighting for the kaupapa only to be ignored. This Government won't listen to you, but Te Pāti Māori have heard you. We will get rid of this Government in 2026, and the Regulatory Standards Bill along with it. Kia ora tātou.\nFRANCISCO HERNANDEZ (Green): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise in anger to denounce the Regulatory Standards Bill. I would describe this bill as a wet fart of a dying Government that's run out of ideas, that's incompetent of doing what everyday New Zealanders want.\n: At a time when our economy is at a record low and our unemployment is at a record high, at a time when a measles outbreak is rising out of control, and property damage from a climate-exacerbated natural disaster is still being repaired all around the country, you would think that this Government would be focused on that and the real issues. But, no, they've put this at the top of the Order Paper. Why? Because, fundamentally, they're a distracted, out-of-touch, ideological Government that's focused more on their imported culture wars and their pet projects than serving the needs of ordinary New Zealanders.\n: There's been a number of super-heated, inflated claims about this bill from the other side. The first claim that's been made by the proponents of it—and, by the way, we've seen speeches from the opposite benches. We've had Mr Seymour not even give the full speech—eight minutes—we've had a one-minute speech from Mr Brewer over there, and we've had a one-minute speech from Ms Costello over here, because, fundamentally, they know that this bill is actually indefensible. They know that this bill can't be defended, because it's got no real substance to it.\n: They say that it's about better regulation, but better regulation for who? It's certainly not for the people, if you listen to the submissions of all the number of people who have submitted against it—98.7 percent opposed—it's certainly not for the planet, if you listen to the submissions of experts, like the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment and groups that care about the environment, like 350 Aotearoa, Forest & Bird, and Greenpeace; and it's certainly not for Te Tiriti, if you listen to the expert submission by the Waitangi Tribunal on why this bill is so bad.\n: We've heard claims that this bill will cut red tape and actually introduce a new era of prosperity where there'll be fun for all and a new level of economic activity. But if you actually listen to what the Government's own advisers have to say about this, they've said the opposite. They've said that creating a regulatory environment which is subject to chop and change, like this bill will do—because we will chop and change this bill up next term—is actually the opposite of how you create a stable environment for good investment in economic growth. This bill will cost a minimum of $60 million, and actually a lot more if you consider all the costs that's being spent on the Ministry for Regulation. So rather than cutting red tape, this bill actually creates the opposite of it. It creates a tsunami of yellow tape that will strangle the Public Service and that will create distractions from core work. So much for a Government that claims to care about economic efficiency, when the bill will do the opposite with their consistency assessment standards.\n: Finally, this bill makes claims about good lawmaking. As we've heard from my colleagues Chlöe Swarbrick and the Hon Dr Duncan Webb, this bill has actually followed the opposite of the process of good lawmaking. From the abuse of urgency that this Government has undertaken in various legislation such as the pay equity bill, to cutting off the number of oral submissions, this bill actually gives the opposite of how you would do good lawmaking in this country.\n: We've heard this bill denounced as an ACT Party bill, but the reality is that while David Seymour might have created the legislation—and the legislation is the gun—the reality is that Winston Peters and Christopher Luxon loaded the bullets with their complicity in allowing this legislation to pass.\n: Now, what would the Green Party do instead? Well, we actually care about genuinely good legislation, and so the first step would be to repeal the Regulatory Standards Bill and to end the tsunami of yellow tape that this bill will create. The second is that we will abolish the Ministry for Regulation and end the libertarian industrial bureaucracy complex that this Government has entrenched in their current lawmaking. We will end the shoddiness of poor decision-making and the number of abuses of urgency that this bill has created.\n: I want to spend the next 15 seconds thanking the submitters who have helped to create amendments to this bill, and all of the people who have taken part in this process. This Government has not and will not listen to you, but we have and together we will make this a one-term Government.\nPAULO GARCIA (National—New Lynn): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The object of the Regulatory Standards Bill is to increase transparency in regulation and the resulting accountability with the New Zealand public. I commend this bill to the House.\nHon RACHEL BROOKING (Labour—Dunedin): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for this opportunity to speak on the Regulatory Standards Bill. It is, somewhat, déjà vu for me because, whilst I haven't been involved in the select committee process on this bill, last term, we had a member's bill in the name of David Seymour, and it was very similar to this. I was able to speak on that bill when, of course, we voted it down. That is what we will do when we have the opportunity. This bill will be repealed. This bill is vain. This bill is ideological in a very negative way. I say that despite what the introduction on the select committee report back says. I will read that to you. The first sentence is: \"This bill seeks to support the executive's accountability to Parliament\". I have to say, that sounds like a wonderful and glorious ambition.\n: As somebody who is part of Parliament but not part of the executive—the executive being the Ministers; there's not many of them in the House at the moment—most of us are members of Parliament; we are not members of the executive. We hear, over and over again, that Parliament, this Parliament of all of us, the executive members and the non-executive members, is sovereign. We can make the laws, but what actually happens is that an executive can have so much power that they make sure that all of their members, all of their non-executive members that are part of Parliament, just go along with them and don't do any scrutiny. That is a real problem if Parliament changes as drastically as it has this term.\n: This term of Government has seen an egregious use of all-stages urgency and giant amendments coming in at the committee stage with no recourse for the non-executive Opposition members to scrutinise that, to ask experts about what the changes might mean. I hear often from the other side, \"In the last term of Parliament, there was lots of urgency used.\" There's a big difference between all-stages urgency and using urgency for different parts of a bill because you require more House time. Those two things are very different. There is also a huge difference when a bill is passed under urgency because there is something like an emergency—that is a good use of urgency—and when there are pieces of legislation passed that have post-enactment review provisions so Parliament can accept that it does need to do this thing quickly because, say, we had some space legislation earlier this year where there might be a national security interest. That is a good reason to pass something under urgency. But then, you have a post-enactment review placed so that the parliamentarians have an opportunity to scrutinise that legislation; this Government does none of those things.\n: It is quite ironic that we have this bill here and that the introduction from the select committee starts with the sentence that this is about changing the dynamic, moving away from executive powers to parliamentarian powers. That is not what this bill is doing at all. What this bill is doing, and we heard from the Minister say something about mojo—which we hear a lot from that Government, that's all they seem to like to talk about—and then he said pieces of legislation need to be justified against some criteria. That sounds reasonable, but, of course, the criteria are David Seymour's criteria. They are not Rachel Brooking's criteria, and they are not many other people's criteria. I am amazed that both National and New Zealand First seem to have been so bamboozled by this that they have laid down and agreed to David Seymour's libertarian criteria to be used in an expensive process that will cost us all time and money and not result in better lawmaking and not, importantly, result in more power of the Parliament over the executive. We have his criteria, and he described, in his speech, that they were just rights of ordinary people and that they were, of course, not collective rights. And so, as I said before, these are not the Rachel Brooking rights. If they were Rachel Brooking rights, they would include ones about our Treaty arrangements—of course, one of our most important constitutional documents—but, no, they're not there. They would, of course, include something about the environment and, maybe, the principle of polluter pays—that's something that should appeal to libertarians—but, no, that's not in this bill either.\n: We've heard from Dr Duncan Webb that this was a solution looking for a problem and that there have been many submissions about this question. If you do want to actually do what this first sentence says—to support the executive's accountability to Parliament—what might you do? In 2019, before I was in Parliament, the Legislation Act 2019 was passed. This Act has a Part 4, yet this Part 4 is still not in force. I just want to quickly read the purpose of Part 4 of that piece of legislation, \"Disclosure requirements for Government-initiated legislation\". Section 101 states: \"The Purpose of this Part—is to (a) better inform parliamentary and public scrutiny of Government-initiated legislation; and (b) promote good administrative practices for the development of such legislation.\" That sounds to me like a very fine ambition, one that appears to mirror what has been said about this version of the Regulatory Standards Bill. Yet I have not seen the Minister or any proponent of this bill explain why it is that they don't just bring into force Part 4 of the Legislation Act 2019. Of course, we already have in existence the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. We heard mention of them before, again from the contribution from Dr Duncan Webb. This committee are, and I say this with admiration, are some truly independent law nerds, and they look at the legislation—they don't look at the policy; they look at the legislation—and say whether or not it will work and how it could be improved. So, they already exist. Again, why are they not mentioned?\n: I want to conclude by being very clear that the executive's accountability to Parliament should be strengthened, and there are some ways to do that. One of the ways is to bring in Part 4 of that Legislation Act 2019 that I just read out. One of the ways could be bolstering the role of that Legislative Design and Advisory Committee. This is something that the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment submitted on. Another one would be not to be using all-stages urgency for bills that have nothing to do with emergencies or any sort of national security, because all-stages urgency means that when the ACT Minister comes in with a pay equity bill, we don't see it until she stands up and starts speaking on it, we go to the table and pick up that bill, and then we go through all the stages of that legislation at once. That is a disgraceful and stupid way to make legislation, whatever you think of the policy. So, we will repeal this bill. It is a terrible bill.\nDAN BIDOIS (National—Northcote): For the members' benefit, I just want to highlight the purpose of this bill, which is to hold power to account and to raise the standard of lawmaking and policy making in this country. I think we've all got great examples from across the House of poor policy that we've seen, and the purpose of this bill is to strengthen that. That's why this bill sets out standard principles for good regulation. It sets out a process that it needs to go through and sets out a regulatory standards board to provide a way for Kiwis to have their say on bad and poor regulation, and it ensures that Ministers and agencies take their obligations seriously.\n: As a member of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, it was good to hear those that came before us. I wish to thank those submitters. We did make some changes to this bill, and I look forward to debating those throughout the stages.\n: But I wish to clear up some mistruths about this bill that have been fed from the other side. The first is that this takes away the sovereignty of Parliament. It does not take away the sovereignty of Parliament. There's nothing in this bill that prevents us from passing legislation, and, with that, I commend this bill to the House.\nHon PEENI HENARE (Labour): I normally have a lot of respect for Mr Bidois on matters relating to this particular bill and other bills that we've debated in this House, but Mr Bidois, in his speech to the House this afternoon, made it very clear he didn't listen to the vast majority of submitters who opposed this bill. Making good legislation in this House is about making legislation for the people. How is it that over 98 percent of those who submitted on this bill opposed this bill, and yet the Government continues to push on with its legislation agenda, of which the Regulatory Standards Bill is one?\n: Every bill in this House has a whakapapa—it has a history—and it's easy to start at the Treaty principles bill, but I won't do that. For context, the history of this bill started in the negotiations between the National Party and the ACT Party, where the National Party and the ACT Party in their coalition agreement came up with the Regulatory Standards Bill. Now, I could go back a little bit further, to past iterations of the ACT Party in Government where they tried to do a very similar thing. It still got the cut then, and yet this ACT Party continues with it to this day.\n: The National-led Government under Christopher Luxon negotiated, in their negotiations for the coalition, to have this bill come into the House. Now, how is it, then, that on that side of the House they can stand there hand on heart and say \"We are making legislation for the people.\", when the people clearly do not agree with it?\n: Moving on to the heritage of this bill, the perennial beat-down on Māori in this country has been nothing but absolutely revolting from this Government from the time that they took office in 2023, and, yes, it did start with the Treaty principles bill. When they say, on that side of the House, \"We're here for efficiencies to make Government work better.\", well, they tried to push through a bill that wasted taxpayers' dollars on a process that was never ever going to get across the line, yet we had to suffer the division forced on our communities, and we continue to do so with this particular bill.\n: Now, if the Minister today had stood up and said, \"I heard all of the great suggestions from those who made submissions on this bill and we've incorporated some of those into the next iteration of this bill, in its second reading.\", well, we might have listened a little bit more. But, in reading the legislative statement today, what we see here is not only are there minor amendments; one of them actually continues to rub the salt in the wounds of Māori, who have only just recently suffered under the passing of the marine and coastal area (MACA) legislation in this House.\n: The legislative statement quite clearly says here that \"A clarification has been made to provide a consistent approach to excluding legislation that gives effect to customary marine title under the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011\". Well, why don't you rub it in? Why don't you rub the salt in the wound, when this House has already gone and done that and made it even harder for anyone to try and seek customary title under the MACA legislation?\n: Now, we have a reminder here, in the second reading of this bill, in the Minister's legislative statement, where he, in an attempt to try and assuage the voter out there, has said, \"Oh well, we've excluded those who have already been recognised under the MACA.\" Well, I'd ask this House: how many of those who have sought customary title have been recognised under MACA? No, people across this House probably don't know the answer, but I can tell you that I'm aware of only one, and that is the settlement that was reached with Ngati Porou.\n: There's another attempt by this Minister and this particular bill to say, \"There's nothing to see here. We still want to respect individual property rights.\", but that, actually, is not what's happening here. We know that what this Government has done, with the way that they've passed their bills, that it is a challenge to the democratic processes of this House. How many times have members in this House sat on select committees where the process has been truncated in this term? Far too many—in fact, more than I've experienced in the three terms prior to this term.\n: Hon Rachel Brooking: That's if it goes to select committee.\nHon PEENI: HENARE: That's how many, and my colleague here made the very good point that when you rush things under urgency, nobody gets to see the bill. Members don't even get to see the bill until it's tabled in the House. Well, if we don't get to see it, that means the people of this country don't get to see it, and that side of the House wants to talk to us about good lawmaking? They want to talk to us about good democratic processes?\n: Well, this is another affront to the democratic processes of this House and the ones that I know New Zealanders believe in, right up and down this country. We will repeal this legislation when we get the opportunity, and we do not support it.\nCATHERINE WEDD (National—Tukituki): Look, red tape and regulation has been holding this country back for far too long—much of it introduced under that previous Government. We need to get rid of the unnecessary red tape holding our farmers and our growers, our primary sector, our horticulture sector back. We need to get the wheels moving. We need transparent regulation, smarter regulation, and less regulation so that we can strengthen this economy and lift wages for everyone. I commend this bill to the House.\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): The introduction of this bill tells us that the \"bill seeks to support the Executive's accountability to Parliament for developing high-quality legislation and exercising stewardship over regulatory systems.\" This is Government that we have seen over the last two years flout their responsibility as a Government to have proper scrutiny of the regulations that have been put in place.\n: We have had unprecedented numbers of bills coming to this House without regulatory impact statements. This is a Government that can't even use the existing apparatus that exists to ensure that we are making good laws in this House. We've had member after member on the Government backbenches jumping up and defending laws that they have no idea about the impact of, because none of us in this House do, because this is a Government that has just blatantly disregarded its responsibility when it comes to oversight of our regulatory systems in this country.\n: Now, we are not supporting this bill; my colleagues have made that clear. In fact, the Labour Party has made this clear at every stage of this piece of legislation. It is a deeply flawed and ideologically driven bill. It is an example, yet again, of the tail wagging the dog. This is where David Seymour got one over Christopher Luxon in the coalition arrangements and shows, yet again, what weak leadership we have from our Prime Minister—what weak leadership we have from the National Party in terms of standing up for what is right and what is wrong. I feel sorry for the New Zealand First members. I suspect that they know that this is deeply flawed legislation but are being forced to vote for it because of their coalition arrangement.\n: Let's go through and have a look at what this bill does. On the face of it, we see what—it sets out the principles about what we should be taking into account when we make law. It sets up a board that is appointed by David Seymour, and can be directed by David Seymour, to look into legislation. If we have a look at what this bill does, one of the things it does is it puts the primary of private interests over the collective interest at every point that it can.\n: Now, let's consider what that could do. We had Transpower, for example, come and give a submission to the Finance and Expenditure Committee about clause 8(c) of the legislation that pointed out because of this regulation, if in the national interest we need to upgrade our power grid—which we will, we will need to put more infrastructure into place—that because of what is laid out in this bill, New Zealanders will pay more for their power; that there will be a requirement because of this legislation for compensation to be paid.\n: Now, we see this in multiple ways. In fact, 98.7 percent of the people who came and submitted on this bill pointed out what problems there were with this legislation. I want to point out how wide the opposition was to this bill, how wide-ranging it was. We heard from the Law Society, we heard from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, we heard from iwi, we heard from groups that spanned a huge broad span of New Zealand society how problematic this piece of law is in so many ways. We heard from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment the way in which this legislation will impede our ability to make laws that protect our environment, to make laws that put in change the necessary provisions we need to do to counter climate change. These were things that we had respected bodies, like the Parliamentary Commission for the Environment, come and give their submissions of.\n: We also heard from iwi repeatedly of the failure of this legislation to take into account the Treaty of Waitangi. This comes within a bundle of legislation that this Government have passed—not only with the Treaty Principles Bill, we've had the marine and coastal area legislation that my colleague, the Hon Peeni Henare, just talked about, that this really is part of the trifecta from this Government of having a complete attack on Māori and Treaty rights in this country.\n: Now, under the shadow but trying to hide behind a fig leaf of good lawmaking, we have a Government that really is cutting to the heart of who we want to be as a country and what we want to be able to achieve with our legislation. That what we can see in terms of the rule of law, liberties, the taking of properties, taxes, fees and levies, the role of the courts, and good law making; these might seem on the face of it very sensible provisions. But we in no way are not saying that we should have proper transparency and oversight of the way in which we make law in this country. But we have a Government that can't even use the existing apparatus. Time and time again they've just bypassed the regulatory impact statement. They've brought legislation to this House that simply does not have that statement with it. The Cabinet hasn't considered regulatory impact statements when they're making decisions whether or not to progress legislation.\n: Focus on individual liberty: this obsession that the ACT Party have got into the Government's agenda with this single focus on individual liberty does not recognise the duty that we have as lawmakers to protect a vast array of things for future generations—that it is our job as lawmakers to make sure that we are thinking beyond just the individual rights of a single entity or a single person and think about what we need to do to protect Aotearoa New Zealand and make sure that our children and our grandchildren can benefit from things. All of these things need to be considered when we are making laws.\n: When we look at the submissions that we heard, as I said, 98.7 percent of the submissions opposed it. That should give a Government pause for thought, the fact there was overwhelming opposition to this bill. We weren't talking about just a small number of submissions. There were a very large number of submissions that came in. They went through an absolute range of things that could be put in place. One of the things, when we look at the taking of property principle that is in the legislation, it is unworkable. We heard this time and time again from those who came and submitted to the select committee, suggesting that a property right should not be impaired without fair compensation. This is what is in the legislation: where that impairment of property rights benefits one person but causes a detriment, the person who benefits should provide compensation.\n: One of the questions that we asked, and Government members on the committee refused to engage with, is: what about laws that we make in this country around healthy homes? What about where we say that, actually, people deserve the right to live in a home that does not make them sick. That as legislators we should have the ability to actually legislate to say there are minimum standards around the homes that we allow people to live in so that we don't add to the health burden of this country and to the detriment of individual's health.\n: What about swimming pool fences? Now, this will probably be something that will excite David Seymour a great deal—in terms of the reason why we have laws around we may do safety measures like this. This is in terms of the taking of property principle. These are where we are thinking about the collective benefit over that individual benefit. What about if a district plan would change to place height restrictions on a building to preserve the sunlight to a neighbouring building that would impair one landowner's property rights for another's benefit? That's clearly unreasonable to expect the neighbour to compensate the owner of the restricted land. These are all the kinds of issues that were raised at select committee of why this bill is unworkable.\n: This is a piece of law that is simply the ACT Party flexing its muscle with a weak majority party within a coalition that has no ability to stand up for New Zealanders and is letting New Zealanders down. New Zealanders are being stuck with a piece of legislation that is to their detriment.\nDr HAMISH CAMPBELL (National—Ilam): Excellent, I have the 12th spot in this debate, and we have heard a lot of hyperbole and a lot of rubbish in this debate. This bill is very clear: it aims to bring the same discipline to regulation that some argue we already accept and expect in our fiscal management. It aims to set clear principles for good regulation, and then requires Ministers and agencies to disclose and explain any inconsistencies. The board's advice to Parliament is non-binding, contrary to what we've heard. It cannot strike down laws. Urgent or exceptional laws can still proceed, but departures must be transparent and justified. This is about transparency and holding the executive to account.\nASSISTANT SPEAKER (Greg O'Connor): The question is that the amendments recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Committee by majority be agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendments be agreed to.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15 Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: Amendments agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That the Regulatory Standards Bill be now read a second time.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: Motion agreed to.\n: Bill read a second time.\nASSISTANT SPEAKER (Greg O'Connor): I declare the House in committee for consideration of the Education and Training Amendment Bill (No 2) and the Medicines Amendment Bill.",

        "content": ": Part 1  Amendments to principal Act, and Schedule 1\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): We come first to the Education and Training Amendment Bill (No 2), and we begin with the debate on Part 1. Part 1 is the debate on clauses 4 to 29, \"Amendments to principal Act\", and Schedule 1. The question is that Part 1 stand part.\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Kia ora and good evening, Madam Chair and members of the Parliament. Before we begin the committee's discussion this evening, I just wanted to open the debate by once again thanking members of the public who provided their comments on this bill, and I also thank the members of this House who were sitting on the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The feedback that we received has been valuable in helping us better understand differing viewpoints and shaping a more structured and informed discussion today.\n: As I mentioned during the second reading, this bill introduces several important changes that advance the Government's commitment to improving student achievement. It requires that school boards will make educational achievement their paramount or highest priority or objective. It also strengthens initial teacher education, ensures teacher discipline and competence processes are fit for purpose, and provides clear procedures for managing industrial action within the school system, alongside other improvements to the education system.\n: One of those key proposals in this bill is to amend section 127 so that educational achievement and attainment becomes a school board's paramount objective. It is the highest priority in school governance. By placing student achievement right at the heart of what boards should focus on, we are supporting schools to return to the fundamentals of education and get them right. This change ensures that every learner can gain the knowledge, the skills, and the competencies they need to reach their full potential.\n: The bill also includes proposals aligned with other key Government priorities, including raising our national student attendance. To support this, the bill introduces new requirements for schools to have attendance management plans that set out how the school will respond to and address the diverse underlying causes of non-attendance. My colleague the Associate Minister of Education, David Seymour, will also speak to and address questions in the committee that anyone may have on these proposals.\n: Similarly, the bill also introduces a proposal to require universities to protect and promote academic freedom and freedom of expression in universities. It's vital that universities remain spaces that foster debate, encourage ongoing learning, and expose students to a diverse range of viewpoints so that they can develop into the critical thinkers that we need. My colleague the Minister for Universities, Minister Reti, will speak and address questions on this proposal.\n: Alongside the proposals in the bill, I'm also announcing that I'll be introducing two Amendment Papers during our discussion in the committee today. The first Amendment Paper proposes to rebalance the Teaching Council's membership. It proposes a majority of ministerially appointed members by removing the teacher education position and adding a ministerially appointed member. This change will help ensure that appointed appointments are focused on professionalising the council and strengthening its strategic capability to more effectively perform its key regulatory function.\n: The second Amendment Paper relates to additional changes to school board objectives in section 127, and it responds to the Government's Treaty reference review. During this review, concerns were raised about whether it is appropriate for boards to be held accountable for meeting the Crown's obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi. School boards are made up of parents and community members, who volunteer their time to support and run their local schools. This Government does not believe that it is reasonable to expect these parents, who are, effectively, volunteers, to carry legal responsibilities that rightly belong to the Crown.\n: This Amendment Paper proposes the removal of the explicit requirement for boards to give effect to the Treaty of Waitangi from section 127. It's replaced by explicit objectives for school boards to seek equitable outcomes for Māori students, to take all reasonable steps to provide for te reo Māori, and to reflect the school community's cultural diversity in its policies and practices.\n: Given that my colleagues Minister Seymour and, shortly—I hope—Minister Reti are here to speak to the attendance management plans and the freedom of expression proposals, I'd welcome members' questions on these proposals first. Then I can speak and answer questions from members on the other proposals in the bill, as well as the Amendment Papers.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Point of order, Mr Chairperson. Thank you, Mr Chair. I just wanted to get a clarification from the Minister of Education. Right at the end of her speech, the Minister's recommendation was that we look at the questions on universities and attendance plan, etc., first, before coming down to other things like section 127, which is within her mandate—or is it that anything goes? I just wanted to check.\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Well, just before I call the Minister, it's up to the members to ask whatever question they like. However, it's up to the Minister, if she can give any indication—\n: Hon Erica Stanford: Yes.\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): But the questions will be—\nSHANAN HALBERT (Labour): Speaking to the point of order—thank you, Mr Chair. I'm just seeking your guidance on this and the follow-up. Given that the Minister of Education has indicated that Minister Reti will be arriving to respond to the freedom of expression component in Part 1, how does the Minister—or yourself, as Chair—recommend that we ask questions based on that, given that the Minister hasn't arrived at this stage? Should we postpone those questions, or how would—\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Well, I would suggest that if members want the best answer from the Minister, they would probably be able to observe whether the Minister is here or not. I would say, looking at the bill, that there is plenty of material that will lead up to the arrival, or otherwise, of any Minister.\nSHANAN HALBERT (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair. I just wouldn't want to miss the opportunity to ask the Minister for Universities directly—as outlined by the Minister of Education—the questions we need to, relative to this bill. So I just seek that commitment.\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Well, once again, the questions will be actually through this Minister, and, generally, she will play something of a puppet master around how the other Ministers—the first questions, generally, are primarily directed through her. I'm sure she will be very quick to direct questions to other Ministers where she believes they have greater expertise or can provide a better answer than she can.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Tēnā koe e te Māngai o te Whare. Despite the Minister of Education's preference to deal with attendance and universities from the outset, we actually can't do that, because the Minister for Universities is not here, and I'm a bit worried that the jumping all over the place is going to make it difficult for us to track what has been covered off and what hasn't been covered off. I want to say that I think, when we look at the bill, there's actually a quite thematic approach that we should be taking to this, because the clauses are—for example, issues that we want to raise around the National Education and Learning Priorities (NELPs) and Te Tiriti in clause 8 and clause 9 also come under clause 127; attendance is in clause 9 and clause 23; universities are in clauses 12, 7, and 11; and then we have the Teaching Council later on. So I propose I would like to make my contributions along the lines of a thematic approach, and the Minister can figure out who needs to answer what questions, depending on what we all put to her in our contributing speeches.\n: I want to start by saying that the Minister, in her opening speech, acknowledged the public and the submissions process, but what she failed to do in that acknowledgment is actually acknowledge that the majority of submissions were opposed to these proposed changes; in fact, 80.5 percent of the submissions disagreed with the proposal to make educational achievement the primary objective. So the Minister, on the one hand, thanks the public for participating in this process, and then—typical of this Minister—she absolutely ignores them. She ignores the submissions that they've given and the feedback that they've given back and continues to push ahead anyway, always so dismissive of the points that they're making.\n: I would also make the point that these changes are not based on evidence; they are based on the Government having a coalition agreement between the National Party and the ACT Party. It is, in fact, in there that this is the baseless politicisation of education in Aotearoa, which is a troubling trend with this Government, including the latest Amendment Paper that we have received this afternoon about removing Te Tiriti o Waitangi provisions for the board. What we have here is that the Government has a very narrow and antiquated view of education, which is fitting for this Government because they have little interest in meaningful engagement and collaboration with the sector.\n: My question to the Minister is: where is the evidence of the collaboration with the sector on the changes that she is making—which is acknowledged and, actually, it is being celebrated by the Hon David Seymour, who is saying this is a win for them because this is something that they campaigned on and that they put in their coalition agreement. So my question to the Minister is: where is the evidence of her engagement and collaboration with the sector on these proposed changes?\n: What we have here is a very simplistic solution that is not evidence-based. While the Ministry of Education and the Minister of Education portrayed a view that nothing will change under the new drafting, there is a reason why statutory interpretation actually exists, and the changes to section 127 do have interpretation repercussions.\n: In that first contribution, I just want to know, given that the Minister acknowledged the public and the effort that they went to to make submissions into this process, why she ignored that the majority of them were opposed to these proposed changes, and what evidence can she give this committee of the whole House of the collaboration that she did with the sector?\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Sorry, Mr Chair, the Minister was just getting up to respond. [Member is given the call] OK. Right, so, like the previous speaker the Hon Willow-Jean Prime mentioned, we are going to take quite a thematic approach, and I think this bill does lend itself to that quite nicely.\n: We are starting with replacement section 127, inserted by clause 8—and just a signal to the Chair as well that we will then move on to attendance, universities, and the Teaching Council, in that particular order.\n: Now, starting with section 127, I also want to signal to the chair that the Minister has released a very substantial Amendment Paper yesterday, without public consultation, without notifying anyone. Usually it has been the case in the past that when Ministers do bring a bill or have those Amendment Papers, that they at least make the House aware that a certain Amendment Paper has been released, as a sign of good faith. But we also didn't really see that. So I really want to just request to the Chair that we do need to, because it is substantial, be given the full opportunity to examine this, as well as where the intention of this particular amendment came from. I think I'm referring to Amendment Paper 408.\n: So on section 127, this is clause 8 we're looking at and this is something that we sort of never got clarity on despite the select committee stage, and I understand the Minister's position is that we want to have a single paramount objective, but then the Minister was also like, \"Nothing is going to change.\" So the question then is why make that change if nothing is going to change? If we are making that change, having the singular paramount objective, then something would be changed in terms of how the board is going to work. So if something is going to change, then could the Minister walk us through, operationally, on how school boards are expected to see that change?\n: That's my first question for the Minister and I do want to touch on, I guess, one of the bigger questions—and I also have an amendment to this particular section as well, which I will mention later, but I want to touch on the second question, which is on the Minister's Amendment Paper 428. So this is the Amendment Paper that came in yesterday, and this is the troubling amendment where the Minister has removed Te Tiriti o Waitangi, specifically the giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi in new section 127(2)(e).\n: While I understand the Minister is saying that, \"Oh well, some of the criteria are still there.\"; that's very different to giving effect to Te Tiriti, because giving effect to Te Tiriti is far more holistic than that. So other than what the Minister has just mentioned before, what sort of advice has the Minister received? I also want to look to the Minister who, in this case is also responsible for—hold on, let me just quickly check; it is in clause 11 of the Education and Training Amendment Bill. Nope, it's not in that one. I'll try to find it in another contribution, but I guess the question is: where is this coming from in terms of the removal of Te Tiriti? But also, more importantly, what we also want to check with the Minister is what consultation has she then undertaken with the New Zealand School Boards Association, noting that the school boards are going to be the ones who are implementing this. I'll leave those two questions for the time being. So exactly what is being changed? Walk us through the operational aspect and where did this amendment come from?\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): In relation to the first question that was questioning the consultation, there has been consultation on section 127. There was public consultation on the proposal to amend section 127 and to remove the National Education and Learning Priorities provisions from the Act between 2 September and 14 October 2024. The Ministry of Education consulted in 2024 on section 127, making achievement paramount—\n: Hon Willow-Jean Prime: And what was the advice?\nHon ERICA: STANFORD: —before introducing the bill, so—she asked specifically about consultation.\n: Just making some comments in relation to the second question about the process, I'd just like to point out that the process is that the Amendment Paper should go up I think 24 hours beforehand—which it did, yesterday afternoon—and from all my time on the Opposition benches, the job of the Opposition was to keep an eye on the website to make sure that any Amendment Papers were brought to their attention. That's certainly how it's been working since 2017, and so that's what the member should do.\n: In addressing the point around evidence, the evidence is that there have been decades of decline in student achievement, and I know that it hurts the Opposition—especially Willow-Jean Prime—to know that they had six years in Government and didn't manage to raise achievement for tamariki Māori, or any students, at all. I know that that hurts, and I know that it hurts that in 18 months, we have managed to raise the early achievement of phonics and reading for Māori students—\n: Hon Willow-Jean Prime: Oh, tell us about that data.\nHon ERICA: STANFORD: —in just 18 months, and I love it that then they have to say, \"Oh, it must be the dodgy data.\" That's where they always have to go to. Well, I know that it hurts—[Interruption]\n: CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Ms Prime, the good thing about being in the committee stage is that you'll get a chance to go to your feet and respond to this, rather than have a continual barrage.\nHon ERICA: STANFORD: But the point of this change is so that we are all rowing in the same direction, that achievement is the paramount objective of school boards, that we are being very clear and concise in our directions on what boards must do in order to raise achievement for Māori students and achieve equitable outcomes, to make sure that they are offering te reo Māori, to make sure that they are then culturally competent in their schools.\n: We are still being very directive, but what we are doing is saying that the Crown holds the duty when it comes to our Treaty obligation. It was signed between the Crown and iwi Māori. We take that very seriously, which is why we have made sure that every resource that we have produced in English has been also provided in te reo Māori, and that every single professional learning and development, every single resource, and every single policy has also been made available for kura kaupapa and available for Māori immersion units. That's why we are seeing an increase in Māori achievement.\n: It is not the job of well-meaning parents who run schools who are effectively volunteers to be deferred a Treaty duty. Do you know what happened in the last six years since that's happened? Nothing. Student results didn't get any better. I know that that hurts and I know that it hurts that under our Government they have finally started to turn a corner, but when you focus on achievement and have everybody focused on that and following the evidence and the science as to what works, that's what happens. Virtue signalling and empty words smattered around don't actually raise student achievement. The core tenet—the core tenet—of our Treaty obligation as the Crown is to raise tamariki Māori achievement. Unfortunately, the previous Government couldn't do that, and that hurts.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair, and thank you for pointing out that I get a chance in my contributions to respond to the Minister of Education and her virtue signalling about her recent results. I mean, I've seen so much feedback from the sector on those results that the Minister is boasting about, and I do question the robustness of that. I do question the methodology behind it. So maybe if the Minister would like to answer those questions, in terms of that data that she is boasting about.\n: The Minister said that they consulted on these proposed changes in new section 127, inserted by clause 8. I asked the Minister: what was the result of that consultation; what feedback did she get and did the ministry get from the sector around the things that they consulted on before bringing this bill to the House? The Minister didn't talk to any of that, conveniently. She also, conveniently, does not acknowledge that in the public consultation process in select committee that the majority of those that submitted opposed what is being proposed here. So she has this consultation. She ignores all of the feedback. She carries on and pushes ahead anyway.\n: One of the things in this bill that they are proposing to do is to repeal—to repeal—the provisions around the NELPs, that's the National Education and Learning Priorities. This is in clause 5. Those National Education and Learning Priorities were actually developed through extensive consultation with the sector, something this Minister doesn't like to do.\n: Hon Erica Stanford: No, I like to raise achievement.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN: PRIME: No, you don't like to work with—the Minister does not like to work in consultation with the sector. It says that they provide crucial strategic guidance to school boards about areas such as putting learners at the centre; barrier-free access to learning; quality teaching and leadership; and the future of learning and work; and creating a world-class, inclusive, public education system. They are only in place in the Act where children's participation and decision making is required. Does the Minister care about the children and the students at all? Does she care about what they think? What consultation has she done with the children about anything that she has proposed in here?\n: My question, because the point that stakeholders made is that they do not believe that it is necessary to repeal this provision within the Act—so why is the removal necessary when it is not a requirement to issue a NELP but only an option for the Minister is they choose? Why does she want to get rid of something that the sector supports—that, in fact, the sector was involved in the development of, because she doesn't seem to like working collaboratively with the sector and respecting anything that they may have worked on and put forward. So why is the removal of this necessary?\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Interestingly, while submitters on this issue to the bill disagreed with the proposal to remove them, the School Boards Association did their own survey of school board members—so this is more like the public; you could imagine parents and people who are serving on school boards. The survey received 55 percent agreeing with the removal of the NELP. So there is a diversity of views out there.\n: But the views of this Government are that, yes, the previous Government did spend a long time on the NELP, around two years, consulting fully and creating another strategic document—they created many of them—in the end that only required school boards and others to \"have regard to\". So it was a document that they spent a very, very long time on that actually was replicated in many, many other areas and documents that was their work programme. But we have an urgent issue. We have got plummeting student achievement. If the member opposite and her previous Government had spent more time focusing on the children and their outcomes, rather than all of these strategic documents that didn't actually do anything, maybe student achievement would have improved in the six years under their watch, but it didn't.\n: We have used a different vehicle for our six priority areas. Many of the things that are outlined in the NELP are already replicated elsewhere. It is a document that people don't have to give regard to or don't have to follow if they don't want to. We have our work programme. It is outlined in our Cabinet paper and in our press release and shown to the sector on many occasions. I talk about it often; it will never change, our six key priority areas to drive achievement. They're already having an impact.\n: Again, I'll say to the member: I know that it's tough to see this Government raising achievement, when they spent six years with a whole lot of documents and strategies that didn't go anywhere, but that's just really unfortunate.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. I also want to get some guidance from you, Mr Chair. We have heard the Minister of Education, rather than responding to the questions on this particular bill, spending an inordinate amount of time actually attacking the previous Government. So I'm just checking with you, Mr Chair, that if we are opening up shop for political hot takes, then there are a lot of things we could also be saying. But I would like to speak very closely to the bill.\n: CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Well, I'll just answer that question. The Minister is aware that the wider her answers, the more material then comes within scope for those asking the questions. It's been a fairly broad-based debate to date. It is a little bit more difficult to direct to specific parts, probably, while the Minister's answers remain as broad as they do, because there is always going to be that wider scope. Carry on, Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-: NAN: Thank you, Mr Chair. And I think it is important, and what the Minister is saying is important, but I want to look at a few things that I asked before.\n: One of the things I asked is when it comes to the removal of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and potential legal obligations. Let me just say then, the president of the School Boards Association has come out, and I wondered—the first question is around how the Minister keeps on talking about \"core Crown\". The term \"core Crown\" has never come up anywhere else that I know of, so if the Minister wouldn't mind first defining what she means by \"Crown\", because school boards themselves are Crown entities—in effect, school boards are the Crown. So if the Minister is saying that we don't want school boards, as Crown entities, to be in charge of overseeing student work—and let's say schools already have a number of obligations, responsibilities, and accountabilities. We have seen that in the past, school boards have been charged with neglect. So school boards already have to do that. By giving effect to Te Tiriti, it doesn't actually mean what the Minister thinks that it means. So I just want to check, just clarify: what is \"core Crown\", and is the Minister aware that school boards are Crown entities and they do have a legal obligation as well?\n: Which then comes to my second question around Te Tiriti, which is: have the Ministers consulted with the Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti? Because in section 6 of the Education and Training Act, they do give allowances for the Minister to actually collaborate with the Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti on certain announcements. I would assume that the removal of Te Tiriti o Waitangi is probably quite a big one to consult with the Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti on. So I'm just checking if the Minister has consulted with the other responsible Minister in this area, on this, and whether the Minister will see this potentially open up to things like, you know, a Waitangi Tribunal application. Because, again, we do, broadly, have an obligation in Aotearoa for things like the inclusion and, in this case, the removal of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It's not just simply something that the Minister can drop the day before. So that's my third question.\n: On to consultation. I'm glad that the Minister quoted the consultation that she did, and I'm actually very pleased with that consultation. Hats off to the Minister for being one of the few Ministers that released an exposure draft bill. But in that consultation, in terms of making student outcomes the primary objective, the opposition rate—because the Minister cares about numbers, when she quoted 55 percent of school boards didn't like the National Education and Learning Priorities—80.5 percent of the submitters did not agree with making education outcomes the primary objective for section 127. Then, if we're moving on to the select committee stage, 94 percent of the submitters to the Education and Workforce Committee did not agree, or were opposed, to this particular section of making student outcomes paramount in the bill.\n: I know that it does hurt the Minister to consider that the way that we're looking at student outcomes is the be all and end all, but at the same time, if this Minister spends some time in front of a classroom, I feel like that it is a little bit different and it can almost be considered hubris for the Minister to not actually take the advice of the sector with something like this. So that's my third question: if the Minister truly did consult, then why has the Minister not taken on board the other numbers that didn't necessarily agree with her agenda?\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): I'll attempt to answer all of those—there are a number of questions there. Firstly, the core Crown—i.e., the Government of the day and central government agencies—are parties to the Treaty. The explicit duty for school boards to give effect to the Treaty is being removed in recognition that schools are not part of the core Crown. Yes, there are some Crown entities that have Treaty obligations, but school boards are very, very different than any of those. They are predominantly made up of parents who are, essentially, volunteers, who have a range of things that they need to achieve in the governance of their school. We don't, as a Government, and this Cabinet has decided that the core Crown has the duty with iwi Māori in relation to the Treaty of Waitangi and that it is not up to a school board to try to decipher how to give effect to the Treaty. We are, instead, being very clear with school boards: what are the things that you need to do around language, cultural competence, and ensuring that there are equitable outcomes for tamariki Māori so that they are very clear and not having to try and decipher what giving effect to the Treaty is, because that is the job of the Crown; that is the decision of Cabinet.\n: In relation to the second part of the question and some idea that I don't spend time in classrooms, I spent a lot of time in classrooms and with students and talking to teachers and talking to parents—\n: Hon Member: More than anyone—more than anyone.\nHon ERICA: STANFORD: Yes, I'd say you're right, probably more than anybody in this House. It is one of my very, very favourite jobs. But it's also important to not that, yes, there were people who submitted on the bill, there are also a number of other stakeholders in New Zealand, like parents. There are tens of thousands of parents who expect this Government to make sure that when their child turns up to school that they get the very best world-leading education and that they reach their full potential at school. Now, for too long, as I mentioned, those results have been declining, nobody has managed to turn it around. We have a plan, we're putting it in place, we're already seeing the early results of that, and we are unashamedly making sure that when children turn up to school that we turn those results around because, if we don't, then, the future of this country is not in a good space.\n: There may have been a third question that I've missed, and if the questioner wants to raise it again, I'll answer it, because I don't remember what that was.\nHon PHIL TWYFORD (Labour—Te Atatū): Thank you, Mr Chair. I have some questions for the Minister on these provisions that we're discussing. The first is: does she accept that Te Tiriti is the country's founding document? Does she accept that Te Tiriti has constitutional status in New Zealand? Does she think it's inappropriate or appropriate for our public school system to operate in accordance with Te Tiriti, particularly if she does regard it, in fact, as a constitutional document?\n: Does she think that it's a zero-sum game that schools cannot chew gum and walk at the same time; that is, they cannot strive and improve educational achievement and do it while operating in a way that is consistent with Te Tiriti? And, if she does think it's a zero-sum game, and that any energy that a school puts into operating in a way that's consistent with Te Tiriti is energy that cannot be put into educational achievement, what evidence does she have to support that?\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): The member will be very aware that the Cabinet Manual sees the Treaty as a constitutional document, of course. Since 1989, we have had school boards, and we have not had a clause in any part of the Education Act which has conferred or deferred a Treaty obligation away from the Crown to a group of parents who are volunteers on school boards. Now, that change has only been in place for a few years. But I'd also say to the member, there is more than just—\n: Hon Willow-Jean Prime: In recognition that it was failing.\nHon ERICA: STANFORD: You're going to have your say when you get to ask your question, so just [gestures for member to sit down] for a bit, all right?\n: In answer to the member's questions around chewing gum and walking at the same time, there are many things in clause 8 replacing section 127 that we're asking the school board to do, not just to raise achievement. Around student safety and wellbeing, there's parts around making sure that they're turning up to school—attendance—and making sure that they're carrying out assessments. There are a huge amount of things.\n: Not only that, but also we're being very, very clear about what school boards need to do, as I've already mentioned, in order to ensure that there are equitable outcomes for Māori students—that they're offering te reo Māori and that they're being culturally competent in the way that they operate in their school. So there are many things that we're asking the school boards to do, and being very particular, and some of those things are particular to tamariki Māori.\n: But it is, as I've already said, the Crown's responsibility, and it's Cabinet's decision that it is the Crown's responsibility, to honour the Treaty and to make sure that we are abiding by that, and we're doing that in many ways. If you look at our entire work programme, everything we're doing is also in te reo Māori. As I've already mentioned: all of the resources, all of the professional learning and development (PLD). We're providing new assessments for assessing early readers' phonics ability in te reo Māori, which is why we're able to see where and when we need to intervene early for those students who are learning in te reo Māori and immersion units that are in kura kaupapa, so that we can intervene early to make sure that their reading is on track as well.\n: As far back as I can see, no Government has ever mirrored their exact work programme to make sure that all of the resources, all of the PLD, everything that we're doing, every policy, are also there and available in te reo Māori for Māori students as well. And that is why we're starting to see a shift.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Point of order. Thank you, Mr Chair. I want to say that I do take personal offence, under Standing Order 121, from the Minister for using te reo Māori when she is actively removing Te Tiriti o Waitangi from the legislation—\n: Hon Members: Oh, sit down!\nDr LAWRENCE XU-: NAN: Shush, children! When someone is raising a point of order, it is heard in silence. Thank you. My point of order is that I do take personal offence, under Standing Order 121, for the Minister to use te reo Māori when she's actively removing Te Tiriti o Waitangi from the legislation, and I would like for her to withdraw and apologise.\n: Hon Erica Stanford: Speaking to the point of order.\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Yes, you can speak to the point of order, Hon Erica Stanford.\n: Hon Erica Stanford: Madam Chair, it is very clear, in everything that we're doing, that we are supporting te reo Māori in schools, not only making sure that school boards have an obligation to make sure that they're offering te reo Māori but also making sure that everything is available in te reo Māori—more so than any Government ever, that I've been able to see. So there's no need for the member to take offence.\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Is this a point of order, or?\n: Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: No, this is a new call.\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): A new call? OK. Hon Willow-Jean Prime—he ceded the call to you.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. We've just had the Minister, once again, standing up and talking so proudly about her record of te reo Māori. My question to the Minister is: what gave the Minister the right to determine that Te Tiriti o Waitangi means providing resources in te reo Māori? Who gave the Minister and the Crown the sole right to determine that giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi is to simply provide resources in te reo Māori? Who did she talk to?\n: Which iwi, which hapū who signed to Te Tiriti o Waitangi did the Minister talk to, to determine that in order to give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi all she has to do is give some resources and te reo Māori? The duties of the Crown to give effect to and honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi are far more than providing some resources in te reo Māori, OK? The Minister might want to address that one for us.\n: But I want the Minister to also tell me how she can claim that providing resources in te reo Māori is giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi when she is also recolonising the curriculum, whitewashing the curriculum? Who was involved in the rewrite of that curriculum, minimising the use of te reo Māori, minimising Māori concepts and matauranga Māori in that curriculum`?\n: Minister, as the Crown, who did you work with when working with your Treaty partners? Who did you consult? Who agreed that giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi was removing Māori words from 5-year-old students' readers? Can she tell me the answer to that one?\n: Who did the Minister consult with when she decided that giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi meant removing $30 million of funding for Te Ahu o te Reo Māori, which is to train Māori teachers to be able to deliver?\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Can I stop the member for a moment and just ask which clauses you're referring to because I'm trying to find the scope of the questions that you're currently asking. So can you refer me to a clause?\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: Sure, yes. Replacement section 127, inserted by clause 8, the removal of giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Madam Speaker, for your benefit, prior to you arriving, the Minister made some quite broad contributions, and as the previous Chair pointed out, opened herself up to this very type of questioning and debate. So that was made very clear by the presiding officer who was here immediately prior to you.\n: Now, the Minister, in her last contribution, as you were switching over, talked about how she was proud of this Government's record of giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the responsibility of the Crown by giving Māori resources to kids, by translating them. So, I am responding to that. The Minister stopped me as I was interjecting over here and said that I will get my turn. So, in my turn, I am asking the Minister to now answer the questions that she invited me to ask.\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Thank you for the recap. That's helpful in the changeover, thank you.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: Now, I look forward to the Minister answering those questions. I also want the Minister to explain very clearly for the House—\n: Cameron Luxton: And slowly for the member.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: That's right—really slowly, really clearly, in real detail, what she understands the Crown's obligations to Māori under Te Tiriti o Waitangi are. And in the Cabinet Manual, what are the Crown's duties and obligations in education to give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi? What are the obligations of partnership? What are the obligations of active protection? What are the obligations of equity? Can the Minister please tell me what she understands her obligations are, as the Crown, in terms of Te Tiriti o Waitangi?\n: Can the Minister then tell me how she intends to ensure that schools do this if the boards of trustees no longer have any responsibility under this legislation and the proposed removal of this requirement on them? The Minister is going to delegate duties to boards of trustees but not any responsibilities. So how is the Minister, who says she's going to retain that responsibility—what mechanism is she going to have in place to ensure that schools and boards of trustees are upholding her Treaty obligations? Because you're removing one of those provisions. So, can the Minister tell the House, this evening, how she intends to monitor that so that parents across Aotearoa know that she is not simply delegating authority to school boards with no responsibility and that it just falls through some gap, which I'm sure is actually one of the key objectives of this? How will you ensure that that is upheld?\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Going back to the start of that contribution where the member was asking around the provision of te reo resources—and this may go to part of my questions as to why the previous Government didn't do this; I'm now starting to understand it. But under the Waitangi Tribunal's decision, Wai 11—and the member would be advised to go and look at that decision, which says that treating te reo Māori as a taonga is important and that te reo Māori is, in fact, a taonga under the Treaty of Waitangi and it deserves active protection. The way that we do that in education is to make sure that we are providing resources, that there is bilingual education like the kura kaupapa and rumaki units, and that we are actively protecting the language, and a part of that is to provide resources. It's only one way, but it is an important way of making sure that we are actively protecting that taonga of te reo Māori, which is exactly what we're doing. There are a lot more things that we do in order to do that, but the member asked that particular question about resourcing.\n: The member also went on to ask what I think honouring the Treaty means, and I've said this a number of times. In article 3 of the Treaty, it's very clear that the rights and responsibilities are given to Māori as they are British citizens, if you take the literal reading of the Treaty of Waitangi. That means, when we think about education, that tamariki Māori are receiving an education and they have equitable outcomes. That is why that yawning gap between Māori achievement and non-Māori achievement over so many decades has meant that we haven't been doing all we can do to uphold that part of the Treaty, which is why I am so focused on every single thing that I do in the mainstream to make sure we're also doing it in te reo Māori.\n: All of the things I've already mentioned, I won't go over them again, but we are also being very clear with school boards. As I've already said, it's very vague to say to a school board that you need to give effect to the Treaty of Waitangi, because what does that mean, in effect, for a school board? And I'll tell you what, the member opposite hasn't actually said what she thinks that it means. We are being very, very clear. We are saying that you must offer te reo Māori when students request it; you must make sure that you are attempting to achieve equitable outcomes for tamariki Māori, and you must make sure that you are being culturally competent: very clear and specific to boards so they know exactly what they need to do. It's all very well to just put words in without actually being clear about what they mean, because what happens is that boards lose their focus, and we want them to be laser focused on raising achievement, closing the equity gap, and doing those things to raise Māori achievement. That's what we're focused on doing.\nCUSHLA TANGAERE-MANUEL (Labour—Ikaroa-: Rāwhiti): Tēnā koe e te Māngai o te Whare. Tēnā koe e te Minita. Otirā, tēnā tātou katoa. It's my pleasure to stand here as the presiding member of te kura kaupapa Māori o Taperenui a Whatonga to seek further clarification around section 127.\n: Beyond te reo and beyond resources, can the Minister of Education accept that giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi looks different according to iwi, hapū, community, and the tikanga and kawa processes of that iwi, hapū, and community? If so, how can the Minister monitor effectiveness and, of course, ensure consistency? I mean, I'm yet to hear a good argument about why we're honestly mucking around with Te Tiriti o Waitangi.\n: [Authorised reo Māori text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]\n: [Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]\n: It's absolutely unnecessary. To simply say that if someone wants access to their reo, to their culture, they can request it, already disenfranchised people are not going to do that. They are going to sit—\n: Hon David Seymour: Why not?\n: [Authorised reo Māori text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]\n: [Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]\n: —because they've been downtrodden by ridiculous laws like this. That's why Te Tiriti being in these documents is so important, so ignoramuses can't detach people from their culture and their reo. But the question is: how can a Government asking stupid questions like that give us any comfort?\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Direct the questions to the Minister and less of this pointing, thank you.\nCUSHLA TANGAERE-MANUEL: How can anyone in this country feel reassured that Te Tiriti will be honoured when we've got Government Ministers making silly quips like that about the value of Te Tiriti and access to te reo and tikanga and identity?\n: So in simplistic terms, how will the Minister monitor the effectiveness of this? What qualifies the Minister to ensure Te Tiriti will be given effect across schools across Aotearoa and therefore how will she ensure the consistency when the delivery giving effect to this will look different and it should look different in every school community, and that's what boards can be charged with. Tēnā tātou.\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): One of the easiest ways to ensure that you are raising achievement—which is, again, the core tenet of a Treaty duty: to make sure that tamariki Māori are succeeding to their full potential, which we have not done in this country for some time—is to make sure that we're assessing our young people. That's why we created Hihira Weteoro, which is a phonics check that is designed specifically—a world first, as far as we can tell—for Māori children learning in bilingual units. It tests them at 20 weeks, 40 weeks, and 55 weeks—understanding that they are learning in a bilingual environment, in some cases, or in full immersion—to make sure that they are staying on track with their learning. Where they fall behind, we pick them up with our literacy intervention teachers and programmes that we have put in place, which are very, very important.\n: What we're also doing is making sure that, for the first time—this has never been done before; the previous Government didn't do this—we're actually assessing. Taking a sample assessment in our Curriculum Insights and Progress study, where we take samples of children in years 3, 6, and 8 in the mainstream and assess them in reading, writing, and maths to make sure that they're on track and that Government policies are working—for the first time, we're going to be doing that in immersion settings as well.\n: So the best way to make sure that we are achieving equitable outcomes is to actually ask the question, are we? We haven't done that before. We haven't had really good data across our mainstreaming and immersion units.\n: Also, from next year, there will be a requirement to assess, using one of the three assessment tools, reading, writing, and maths, twice a year, every year, from year 3. So it will be very telling how achievement is going and whether or not we are making sure that there are equitable outcomes for Māori students.\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Can I just say, before we take some more questions for the Minister, that we've spent a reasonable amount of time around clause 8 replacing section 127 and the Minister has been answering the questions all the way through. The members may not like some of the answers, but the Minister has actually been answering. So it'd be really good if we could branch out to see if there's anything else in this piece of legislation.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Point of order, Madam Chair. Thank you for that. I do just want to check your understanding, though, because this Amendment Paper that has been introduced around Te Tiriti—the removal of the requirements for giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi—has not been to select committee. This is our only opportunity to ask the Minister questions about this specific point. There are other things in section 127 that did go to select committee, which we haven't addressed yet—\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): I get the point of order from the member. My judgment is that the questions that have been asked to this point about how the Minister is going to ensure and measure have been answered by the Minister. I'm looking for different questions because I feel like the questions since I've been in here for the last 20 minutes have been very similar questions and very similar answers to what I've already seen that the previous Chair has written down. I'm looking for you to broaden out. What I'm saying is you may not like the answer that the Minister's giving you, but it doesn't mean that she's not answering the question.\nSHANAN HALBERT (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate and respect your comments, and I'll do my best to add additional points. The problem here is that the Minister of Education has been quite narrow in her responses and that what we're trying to understand is, actually, how did this decision come about where, at the eighth hour, we've received an amendment; we've been through a select committee process; and our select committee actually does good, constructive, robust work; it wasn't a short process; and so there was every opportunity for the Minister to drop this particular amendment.\n: It is a pattern of behaviour from this Government. This is not the first amendment that is dropped at the eighth hour to remove the Treaty of Waitangi; Minister Simmonds and Government colleagues did the same in the vocational training bill. So it's not new for the Government. It is part of the coalition agreement. So I am confused why the Government is, in fact, dropping such a large piece of discussion that is sensitive in nature and is the foundation document for our country at a late stage in this process. Hence why I'm sort of drilling into the Minister to say \"When did this amendment go to Cabinet and approved by Cabinet, was that this week?\"—just to understand why it's so late in the piece and what consultation keeps on coming up.\n: But she actually hasn't identified for us which groups have been consulted around this particular amendment. It is the removal of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. I acknowledge that she is uncomfortable about doing this and probably is being wedged by the minor parties around her in this Government, the ACT Party and New Zealand First. This is their push, and she will be uncomfortable about this decision. But she is the boss here and she needs to answer these questions in this phase of scrutiny in the committee of the whole House.\n: So which groups did the Minister actually consult with here, which Māori groups as well, and which schools, if any—if any—came back and said to the Minister \"This is a good thing, to put an amendment in place that removes Te Tiriti o Waitangi?\"\n: The next layer of that is about understanding the rationale behind why this is important. The Minister has talked a lot about equity but we haven't unpacked the role that Te Tiriti plays in achieving equitable outcomes for tamariki in our education system. So the question arises: can equity be achieved without our foundation document underpinning the decision making at a governance level in our schools? If that is removed, how do we achieve true equity?\n: The Minister, this afternoon, has come up with examples—some people call it cherry-picking—of the work that the Government is doing in te reo, and the like—which is fine, that's good; I respect those things that they are doing, but that is not equity. That is not equity, Minister—\n: Hon Erica Stanford: What is it? Tell me.\nSHANAN HALBERT: —it is examples—I've still got a minute.\n: Hon Erica Stanford: No, I mean, tell me what those things are.\nSHANAN HALBERT: My question here—it's my job to scrutinise you today, right?\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): The Minister's just asking the member to clarify what he meant by that last statement.\nSHANAN HALBERT: As I said—\n: Camilla Belich: Point of order. Madam Chair, you'll know that there is a Standing Order which prohibits the Minister from utilising the microphone during the committee stage in order to insert comments into the debate. So I just appreciate—\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): I do understand that. I'm just trying to get the best answers out for the questions. If the Minister wants to clarify a question that somebody's asked, I think that's really important for the Minister to be able to answer the question. I don't believe she was injecting herself. I've seen Ministers inject themselves in the past; she was just trying to get some clarification.\nSHANAN HALBERT: Thank you, Madam Chair. The thing I'm trying to understand from the Minister is: what role does she see Te Tiriti o Waitangi playing in achieving equitable outcomes for tamariki in our education system? That has been removed.\n: What has been done here is silencing of Māori voices around a governance group that runs our schools. I'd like her to give me an understanding of if she agrees that that is silencing Māori voices around that table and what's the impact of that.\nHon PHIL TWYFORD (Labour—Te Atatū): Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to say, Madam Chair, this is not repeating questions for the sake of it. I want to respond directly to something that the Minister didn't say in her failure to answer one of my previous questions, but also to respond to things that she actually has said.\n: I finished my last intervention by asking the Minister to share with the House evidence that underpins—I think—her assertion that having the Treaty of Waitangi enshrined in this legislation is somehow a distraction, or detracts, from her objective—that, I think, is shared by everybody here—that we want to see tamariki Māori do as well as they possibly can in the education system. She doesn't answer that.\n: Further, I want to take the Minister's claims at face value that she's committed to supporting the achievement of Māori in the education system, and she's investing and producing resources and so on; and, also at face value, the distinction that the Minister draws between achievement of Māori in the system and the inclusion of Te Tiriti in law. If I can paraphrase what I've heard from the Minister today, she's more interested in educational achievement than she is in, somehow, the kind of symbolism of having Te Tiriti in our education legislation.\n: My question is: logically, why not do both? Why choose one over the other? Why not knock yourself out doing everything you can to encourage Māori to do as well as they possibly can in our education system, and have Te Tiriti enshrined in our law conveying to this and all future Governments our shared obligation to make sure that Māori see themselves reflected in everything we do in public life in this country? Why is she choosing one over the other?\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): The Treaty of Waitangi is enshrined in our legislation. It is deeply enshrined in the Education and Training Act in section 32, and I take that responsibility very seriously. But to have a clause and a board of trustees requirement that says they need to give effect to the Treaty, without actually being very clear on what that means—and it's very interesting that's the members are using words like \"true equity\" and \"really honouring the Treaty\", without even saying what it is that they think. The reason that they won't is because they've got the same problem that boards of trustees have; that they don't know what \"giving effect to the Treaty\" actually means.\n: What we are being very clear on is what they need to do to seek to achieve equitable outcomes for Māori students: to take all reasonable steps to provide for teaching and learning in te reo Māori to students whose parents or caregivers request it; to take reasonable steps to ensure that the policies and practices for at school reflect New Zealand's cultural diversity. What we really need boards focused on is language, is culture, is making sure that students are achieving to the very highest possible of their abilities.\n: But in section 32, deeply enshrined in our legislation, is the Treaty duty, which sits with the Crown, which has been guiding me in all of my policies and all of my decisions. The members opposite might not like to think that providing resources and professional learning and development and making sure that we are providing to Māori language skills to teachers—which we are about to commence with next year, as it was budgeted for this year; all the literacy resources we're providing to schools, secondary schools, kura kaupapa, whare kura—is important. Those things are very important to our Treaty obligation to make sure that we are revitalising the language and making sure that Māori students are reaching their full potential, and that is exactly what we are doing.\n: But what we are saying to boards is, we don't expect you to sit around and try and work out what honouring or giving effect to the Treaty means—because if you want to talk about something being very unclear, that is exactly it. We need, and parents expect, boards of trustees to be laser focused on outcomes for students: getting them to school, making sure they're achieving to the highest possibility, and keeping them safe.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I also just wanted to mention to you, Madam Chair, with the previous Chair, we mentioned there are broader themes within this bill that we want to explore and we're on the section on the obligations of the board, but there is also the other sections of attendance, universities, and the Teaching Council.\n: I want to just check with something that I asked the Minister of Education right at the beginning, which was around not so much broader consultation with the public but more consultation with, potentially, her Cabinet colleagues or with other officials.\n: I think my first question would be: how come, particularly with some of these changes, we haven't seen a child impact statement being conducted, when this particular bill does affect children quite severely? In this case, in terms of a child impact statement, what sort of consultation, particularly with the latest amendment, Amendment Paper 428, that the Minister dropped, has been consulted through Mana Mokopuna, the Children's Commissioner? I think that's also a helpful indicator to the committee that the due diligence, even though we may not have seen it, has been done when introducing something like that into the committee.\n: The other person that I checked with in terms of consultation, for the Minister, was the Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti. That was mainly from the perspective of what, then—I understand what the Minister is saying, the Treaty of Waitangi is available in clause 6, amending section 9, but anything that removes the giving effect of Te Tiriti o Waitangi within any legislation should have serious scrutiny. So I want to know whether the Minister for Māori Crown Relations has been consulted and what this would mean for Māori-Crown relations in general, and has the Minister received advice on what this would mean in terms of potentially an application to the Waitangi Tribunal?\n: All of these included, when we're looking at replacement section 127, inserted by clause 8, I think a broader question that we haven't asked is: sure, the Minister wants to make sure that there is one single paramount objective, but with everything else we're talking about, were there actually other options that were being considered? The Minister has consistently mentioned that it was confusing, that boards are volunteers, and etc.—and I 100 percent agree with that, but, at the same time, what are some of the other ways for us to potentially reach the sort of ability for the school boards to be able to do their role as the governing body of a school by other means, by providing additional resources? Rather than kind of like saying \"You only need to focus on one thing, because you are volunteers and you don't have the capacity.\", was there any option being considered that would give them the capacity to actually consider all of these or give them the resources that would potentially consider all of these?\n: Those are the tangible things. What information, then, have school boards been given on how to communicate or how to involve the mana whenua where the school is based? These are some of the tangible options that, for example, the Minister may have considered. So I'd be keen to hear from the Minister.\n: Now, the Minister has also mentioned, in terms of ākonga Māori and some other things—and I think it's really important to highlight that kura kaupapa, kōhanga reo, kura reo, and all of those sort of things, we are seeing tamariki Māori, etc., thriving in those environments. I don't deny the fact that the Minister has put resources into it. However, 97 percent of ākonga Māori are in English medium; they're not in Māori medium. So while we're celebrating Māori-medium success, what are we doing, signalling to those 97 percent of ākonga Māori in the English medium, saying \"We are now removing the school boards' need to give effect to Te Tiriti.\"? What, then, would the Minister say to these 97 percent?\n: I really want to pick up the question from my colleague Cushla Tangaere-Manuel, because, I think, that question is really important, because what we are hearing from the Minister is that, yes, parents, caregivers, students can request it, but what that translates to is: if you want to do anything that is culturally yours, you've got to bat for it—you've got to ask for it; it is not naturally given to you as your birthright.\n: Ingrid Leary: Madam Chair?\nDr LAWRENCE XU-: NAN: Sorry, Madam Chair? I'm almost done.\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-: NAN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I apologise. I lost track of time.\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): I apologise too because I wasn't watching the clock; I was listening.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-: NAN: I think that's a really important point: what, then, would this signal to ākonga Māori in terms of how the Minister's intent is empowering them to succeed as Māori, not succeed for Māori? That is the really important question when we're looking at a lot of these.\n: Again, I don't deny the fact that the Minister mentioned about success in phonics and all of those, because when you are looking for success, you will find success. But it's also ironic that the Minister uses phonics as an example, because I think it's a really important analogy when it comes to the understanding of phonics and semantics and all of those other things and when you're looking at context within a language, is that, with phonics, the Minister is using Māori like phonics, but the Minister doesn't understand the context of being Māori or what it means for Māori. That's a very, very important analogy when we're looking at purely singular success when it comes to phonetics.\n: The Minister also mentioned te reo Māori being a taonga. Now, we have seen, both in terms of the way that the new curriculum has rolled out, we've also seen, in terms of some of the removal of kupu Māori in books like At the Marae. I want to check with the Minister, when she says that te reo Māori is a taonga, then why are kupu Māori being removed—\n: Hon David Seymour: It's irrelevant to the bill.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-: NAN: Well, it is because that's what the Minister is saying, and the Minister is using this to justify that it's OK to remove giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.\n: Jenny Marcroft: Is there a question?\nDr LAWRENCE XU-: NAN: The question, then, for the Minister is: why has, then, the ministry also decided not to include kupu Māori in any new Ready to Read Phonics Plus books, except for only in character names?\n: So all of those sorts of things, I just wanted to get clarification from the Minister, because the Minister is saying one thing but what we are seeing in terms of the reality and what we are seeing in terms of the announcement is something that's completely different.\n: Just to recap a couple of the questions that I have. The question is: why was there no child impact statement being made? What consultation has she done specifically with things like Mana Mokopuna, in terms of obligation to children, with Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti? What are the potential consequences of application to the Waitangi Tribunal? Has she considered any other options in terms of this particular bill, other than having one paramount objective? What is her position, then, on things like removing kupu Māori when she says that te reo Māori is a taonga?\n: I want to finish with just touching on two additional things. One of the things is around NELP. I understand the Minister was saying, before, that one of the things that was part of the consultation was though NELP was really good, the current NELPs have \"particular regard\". That, I understand from what the Minister is saying. So I would ask the Minister to consider my amendment, Amendment Paper 403, which is to reinstate NELP but actually make it stronger by saying \"to give effect\" rather than just simply removing it altogether. I do agree with the Minister that \"have regards\" is a little bit more vague.\n: I would also like to ask the Minister to consider my Amendment Paper 404. Now, this is one of the other questions I had earlier, which is: if nothing's going to change, why change section 127, everything within section 127, including supporting objectives? I want to pick up particularly on clause 8, new section 127(2) and 127(3). That we change \"To meet\" to \"In addition to\". Now, the reason for that is just to ensure that the supporting objective must be met. So it provides a clarity that has not been provided from a statutory interpretation perspective. So this particular amendment that I want to ask the Minister to consider is to provide a needed clarification that much more aligns the intention of the clause, where supporting objectives must be independently met, rather than have one be conditional on another.\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): I'll just run through those questions. Firstly, there's no requirement for a child impact statement. Secondly, the question around consultation—there was full ministerial consultation, as there always is in a Cabinet process, and Minister Potaka was also on Minister Goldsmith's ministerial advisory group around the Treaty principles work that was done, so he was consulted, of course.\n: Around the claim that I've said nothing will change, that is not the case. What we've said is we want boards to be laser focused on raising achievement, and that's exactly what we expect to happen. But with the clarifications that we're putting into section 127, we are being very clear that there does still need to be—and very importantly—te reo, culture, and making sure that that equity gap is closed in section 127 so that boards are focused on doing their duty and not on a vague clause that says \"give effect to the Treaty\", but they don't know what that means. We are being clear in what it means: those are the things that you must do.\n: The member is talking like there is only one objective for a school board. There are many objectives and they are all essential supporting objectives, but we want to make sure that they are laser focused on achievement.\n: With the National Education and Learning Priorities (NELP), I appreciate the member's position, but this Government has come in with six very clear priorities. The NELP are overly burdensome. They are just one of many documents that school boards have to look at. We're reducing that compliance. We've been very clear on what we need them to do and been very clear on what our six key priority areas are, and that is the work of this Government.\n: There may be some other things I haven't answered, apologies. There were lots of questions and I tried my very best.\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Thank you, Madam Chair. This is my first contribution, and I've been listening very carefully to what can seem like quite an academic and conceptual debate around \"giving effect to\" versus a list of things that are based on assumptions. Picking up on what the Minister of Education just said, we heard about te reo / language. We heard about culture versus \"giving effect to\", which was presented to us as being vague. I wanted to try and ground this in some questions, for the Hansard, actually—for the record—so that I'm reassured that not only our Māori kids but actually the diversity of cultures in New Zealand who benefit from Te Tiriti clauses will not be disadvantaged when it comes to things that do enhance their learning and do improve their academic achievement, and those are around culture and identity.\n: I want to just reference work that I did with the Rt Hon Adrian Rurawhe a couple of years ago and bring the voices of the students into the House. I had a constituent case which was tricky, of a student who was wearing corn braids. That was part of his cultural identity. He was not Māori. The rector at the school decided that that was a distraction, and there was a bit of an impasse.\n: The result of that was that we decided to hear the voices of students. We asked students from different schools—uniformed schools and non-uniformed schools; about six of them, I think, in total, from the greater Wellington region—to come in and give us their experience of having these school uniforms that did not or did require certain things. And this is around identity and culture. It was very clear, from those conversations—there were arguments on both sides, but it was very clear that cultural identity and giving effect to Te Tiriti is embedded in school uniform protocols and in grooming protocols, and that those protocols benefit not only Māori but other students. Actually, it goes a step further, because we also had a gender lens and we were able to understand the difficulty for some people to go into classrooms being required to wear binary uniforms that were distracting to their education. It was very clear that the evidence that the kids were giving us was that what they need to do to achieve is to feel comfortable and confident in their identity and in the rules that allow them to express themselves.\n: As a result of that, the Human Rights Commission drew up a list of guidelines for boards of trustees, and those were received around Aotearoa. They were not mandatory, but they were based on the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, on freedom of expression and identity, and on Te Tiriti and giving effect to Te Tiriti.\n: My question for the Minister now is, if we're going to take that out of the board of trustees' suite of things to consider, does that mean that those school uniform protocols that have been adopted by many schools and welcomed with open arms by many boards of trustees and by many students and that no doubt have led to higher achievement are to be thrown out—the baby with the bathwater? Does it mean that giving effect to Te Tiriti, as I understand what she just talked about, is about culture? So we might think of kapa haka performances, te reo classes, and resourcing. What about these really fundamental questions about self-expression and identity? Because if they are to be in that list of things, I think the Hansard needs to reflect that now so it's very clear. If they are not, if they're seen as a distraction and not part of the core things that boards are to focus on, then I think that needs to be on the record.\n: That, again, goes back to whose perspective on identity and culture we are honouring here. Is it one part of the Treaty partnership or is it true partnership? The reason I ask this is because this is not conceptual. We have had feedback from students, even in my electorate, who have had cultural taonga through moko kauwae, through other things, where they have embraced those. Their schools have embraced them. They have found a new love of learning. They have said how liberating it is for their education, and all the evidence stacks that up. So this is not a conceptual debate, this is real life, and if the Minister agrees that those school uniform guidelines should stand, then I would like that to be on the Hansard so there is absolutely no doubt that we are not ripping away things that have been built carefully with students at the centre of the of the debate.\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): I've already said this a number of times and I'm in danger of repeating myself, but if the member looks at the Amendment Paper, firstly, it does say, \"takes [all] reasonable steps to ensure the policies and practices [at] the school reflect New Zealand's cultural diversity:\", and I expect that schools, as self-managing entities, will continue to do exactly that.\n: There are a number of things in section 127 that are not changing: that a school is a physically and emotionally safe place for its students; that it gives effect to relevant student rights set out in this Act and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990; and that it takes all reasonable steps to eliminate racism, stigma, bullying, and other forms of discrimination within the school.\n: There are a number of things that are already in the Act that protect against those things; it wasn't suddenly in just the last few years since the previous Labour Government put in the obligation for a board of trustees to give effect to the Treaty that suddenly gave rise to all of these things. In fact, the Opposition are speaking like this is a duty that has been on school boards since the dawn of time of boards, which is 1989. In fact, it's only been in since 2020 and it hasn't given rise to these things. In fact, since it's been in place, the core tenet, as I've said, of giving effect to the Treaty, which is raising student achievement, has gone backwards.\n: I can assure that member that schools are self-managing entities, and they will still take these decisions and continue to do so because it is here and we're being very clear in the legislation: take reasonable steps to ensure that the policies and practices of its school reflect New Zealand's cultural diversity. I'm answering all of that member's questions.\nGRANT: McCALLUM (National—Northland): I move, That debate on this question now close.\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): The question is that debate on this question now close.

We will return at 7.30 and begin Part 2. Thank you.\n: Sitting suspended from 6.16 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.\n: Part 2 Amendments to other legislation\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Members, the committee is resumed on the Education and Training Amendment Bill (No 2). When we rose for the dinner break, we had just finished voting on Part 1. We now come to Part 2, which is the debate on clauses 29A to 30, \"Amendments to other legislation\", and Schedule 2. The question is that Part 2 stand part.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Point of order. Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to raise the fact that this is the earliest time we were able to raise a point of order after voting. When we were voting on the bill, before we were seeking to the chair that there are still substantial sections in Part 1 that weren't covered. We had both the responsible Ministers diligently sitting in their chairs waiting for their chance to speak on their part on attendance, universities—also noting for the chair that the Minister has dropped a significant amendment yesterday on the Teaching Council that we haven't had the chance to address as well. This obviously has significant public interest and the public was not consulted. So I want to seek your advice as the chair on when it's been voted, whether we can still have the opportunity in this section to seek some clarifications and questions for the Minister regarding the relevant parts.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Yes, so it's not the chair's role to direct the questioning. Members have the ability to direct questions to the relevant Ministers in the room. However, if you are able to address your concerns or your questions in Part 2 or the \"Title\" and \"Commencement\" stages, then that's fine as well.\nSHANAN HALBERT (Labour): Speaking to the point of order, Madam Chair. An example of that is we had agreed to discuss the freedom of expression component relating to universities in New Zealand in this legislation. It does sit in Part 1. We had an understanding from the chair and from the Minister to be able to speak to Minister Reti as the responsible Minister in that part. We weren't given a signal by the chair at the time to be able to shift into that debate. It is quite a large component on that, and I'm just seeking your guidance and would appreciate consideration to be able to discuss that as part of \"Title\".\n: Hon David Seymour: Point of order.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Just a minute. As I've explained to Lawrence Xu-Nan, it's not the chair's role to direct how members wish to question the Minister or the other Ministers who are in the room. So after two hours—I think—if there hadn't been a question based on those topics, then I think the opportunity is lost. But as I have said, if you can broaden your questions into Part 2 and \"Title\" and \"Commencement\", that is another opportunity where it could be addressed.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Education): Speaking to the point of order, if I may. Madam Chair, I just note that the chair before the dinner break chose to accept a closure motion in full knowledge of where members had directed their questions, so now to dispute that chair's ruling is actually disorderly in itself.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): My rationale is to be helpful to members.\n: Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: Madam Chair?\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): So you are seeking the call now? I call Lawrence Xu-Nan.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I do want to draw the Minister of Education's attention specifically to some of the questions I have around clause 29A, \"Principal regulations\".\n: When we're looking at Part 2, the main element of this part is to amend the Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations, and also in terms of what we see in Schedule 2, as well, which is also part of Part 2. One of the key aspects of the school planning and reporting regulations, and one of the things we see here in terms of the preparation of the first and subsequent strategic plan—a key component of that is actually when we're looking at its association and the reason it's also been delayed, as well, in relevance to the attendance management plan. So I actually do want to ask the Minister some questions on the school planning and reporting plan and how it's going to relate to the attendance management plan.\n: Now, on the attendance management plan, I know that we have voted on some of the earlier clauses, so I won't dwell on my amendment or even the vote, but I do want to check with the Minister that both in terms of something like the attendance management plan but also school planning and reporting regulations, on whether there is going to be a broader scope of—I guess a scope that broadens to some of the social impact that's related to how a school can plan and report on things like truancy and on things like school attendance. The reason I ask this question to the Minister is because we have seen significant investment this year in truancy, which is an important element of any school's planning and reporting, but, more importantly, as I'm travelling around the country and talking to different schools, I realise that a school's ability to plan and report is a lot more complex than simply just to say that students need to attend school.\n: So, I guess, through this particular part, has the Minister, then, considered, as a requirement for the schools' planning and reporting, and in conjunction with an attendance management plan, how a school is meant to be given additional resources? They have already identified issues, but giving additional resources that genuinely address things around school attendance, such as the fact that we have one of the highest rates in the OECD—I know the Minister likes OECD data—for school bullying. We're seeing in the latest report by Asian Family Services, we're seeing 46.3 percent of the parents report that their child has been bullied at school. We know that bullying is a major driver of truancy. We also hear from communities, and particularly rural communities, that the cancellation of school bus routes has been a significant factor when it comes to school attendance and issues with school attendance and students being able to attend.\n: So tying into clause 29A, I want to ask the Minister, while a school is looking at planning and reporting and attendance, how are they going to address some of these broader societal issues or broader issues that are within the realm of a departmental expenditure by the ministry, as opposed to a school's own ability to make certain changes?\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Part 2, the consequential amendment, is very narrow. It is around extending the date—January 1, 2026 to January 1, 2027—for school boards to prepare and deliver their strategic plan. So I'll answer questions around that.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): While I appreciate what the Minister of Education's saying in terms of the dates, the Minister will certainly be aware that anything you put on the table—we can actually ask that. Considering that we are looking at amendments—and we have seen multiple instances, including the fact that, under clause 3, we're able to discuss maybe more broadly some of the purpose and principles around the Education and Training Act 2020—it is not beyond the scope of a committee stage for us to also ask questions around the Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations in general.\n: My question, again, to the Minister is while we're looking at the regulations in the context of education, school planning and reporting, what is the Minister's idea of how a school is able to plan and report with the kind of changes that we are seeing currently—which then involves attendance, which then does involve things like curriculum, which does involve things like changes to the way that teachers are able to have the kind of autonomy to be able to fully participate and have the kind of autonomy to do the work and schools have the autonomy to do the work that they do.\n: Because, again, drawing on the Minister's own release on the amendment that is being dropped in this amendment bill around the Teaching Council; but just drawing on the example that the Minister has used evidence from Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), the OECD report 2024, as a rationale for some of these. But we are also seeing, within that same TALIS report 2024, that it talks about the fact that schools and teachers are really struggling with the lack of decision-making authority that they have. Again, when we are looking at school planning and reporting, I ask the Minister: how is she going to ensure that schools are able to plan and report when all of these changes are happening?\n: Now, the reason I also mention that is I want to draw attention to the Minister and ask the Minister to consider my amendment for clause 29B in terms of the date, because the Minister—you're right, it does already replace the date from 1 January 2026 to 1 January 2027. But in my amendment, I make the argument that with the kind of changes that we're seeing—and particularly with some of the changes that we're seeing in, let's say, NCEA, which isn't coming into effect until much later—a prudent way of asking schools to be able to have that ability to prepare for the first and subsequent strategic plans, which is 29B, is to delay it by a further year. So I do ask, in combination with the questions I asked before, that the Minister consider my amendment that moves the date from 1 January 2027 to 1 January 2028.\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Almost everything that the member mentioned is completely out of scope, and I'm not going to address it for that reason. In answer to his second part, which is in scope, his amendment to change the time, I would note that this change from 1 January 2026 to 1 January 2027 was something that the select committee themselves had put forward and was accepted by the select committee. We agree with it and we're not going to change it any further.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. If I can just help the Minister and take her to clause 30—we're in Part 2, clause 30. Clause 30 is talking about consequential amendments to secondary legislation, and in there it is amending secondary legislation as specified in Schedule 2, as set out in that schedule. If we then go to Schedule 2, it's consequential amendments to secondary legislation. In there, in particular, I want to talk about the Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations 2023. This is in scope, for the Minister's benefit.\n: My questions are around the change with \"replace regulation 71F with the following\", which is F—that's the board strategies for giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, \"including strategies for: (1) achieving equitable outcomes for Māori students; (2) working to ensure it's plans, policies, and\"—and then the word's crossed out, \"local curriculum\", and it's replaced with \"teaching and learning programmes reflect local tikanga Māori, mātauranga Māori, and te ao Māori; and (3) taking all reasonable steps to make instruction available in tikanga Māori and te reo Māori\".\n: My questions for the Minister are around these consequential amendments that are being made to the Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations, and in particular to talk about the removal of the term \"local curriculum\" and the replacing it with \"teaching and learning programmes\". This is a significant change, because teaching and learning programmes are the how of the curriculum, not the what of the curriculum. I think this significant change—it's important that the House, it's important that the public listening tonight are aware that this Government is wanting to remove from boards that responsibility around local curriculum.\n: Why would they want to do that? What else have we seen recently with the release of the refreshed/rewritten curriculum: the minimising of local Aotearoa histories in our school. Local curriculum is a broader concept that refers to the entirety of what a school does, inclusive of teaching and learning programmes, enabling school boards to match learners' needs within the community and to the national curriculum. Reference to the local curriculum empowers teachers to implement the national curriculum in the context that is specific and relevant to the children in their school, and this promotes educational achievement.\n: The process of developing local curriculum is one of the main ways that schools and kura have to build relationships and connections with whānau, with parents, with hapū, iwi, mana whenua, and communities.\n: When the Minister spoke earlier about the board having no obligations now to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, to give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, she talked about the Crown's duty in terms of Article 3 of the Treaty, but she didn't talk about any of the Crown's responsibilities in terms of Article 1 and Article 2. In Article 1, we have partnership; in Article 2, we have rangatiratanga. I want to know how the Minister, in this clause 30, in Part 2, where we are now amending the secondary legislation based on what was voted on earlier, where we have the removing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi as well as the replacing of local curriculum—can the Minister please explain to us why she thinks that is appropriate, how this is not minimising that Treaty relationship, that importance of local curriculum, and the national curriculum in its local context? Can the Minister please—because I believe it is in scope—address those?\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): To be helpful to that member, that particular part in Schedule 2 that she is talking about has been replaced, so all of the things she was talking about have been replaced by Schedule 2 in my Amendment Paper that we already voted on. In terms of Schedule 2, the only parts we are now debating are the first parts: the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 and the Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations 2023. But where it says \"Replace regulation 7(1)(f) with:\", that was replaced with Schedule 2 in the Amendment Paper. We've already voted on it, so that is out of scope.\nCARL BATES (National—Whanganui): I move, That debate on this question now close.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Not quite yet. The Hon Willow-Jean Prime—but I do just want to alert members that we've had only three speeches to the Minister of Education, but we want to keep it very tight on this Part 2, and especially the schedules. Thank you.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): That's right, Madam Chair, and I did keep it very tight to clause 30, and I was asking about those consequential amendments to secondary legislation, which the Minister is trying to tell me that that is out of scope. So I am seeking your guidance, Madam Chair: is the Minister correct that that is out of scope? Because I asked a serious—\n: CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Did I say that was out of scope?\nHon WILLOW-JEAN: PRIME:  No, you didn't, did you? Oh, so the Minister—[Inaudible]. Thank you. Well, then—\n: Hon Erica Stanford: Point of order. I'm sorry, the member just said that the Minister lied—\nHon WILLOW-JEAN: PRIME: No, I didn't. I said you were wrong.\n: Hon Erica Stanford: I heard you say that the Minister lied, and that is not appropriate for this House.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN: PRIME: No, I said she was wrong.\n: CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): I'm sorry, I didn't hear it. If that's the case, I was obviously distracted.\n: Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: Review it.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN: PRIME: No, review it. I don't believe I said she lied. What I said was, I think she is wrong to say that this is out of scope, and I was seeking your direction, and you said you didn't say that, she did—\n: CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): We can check. It'll just take a few minutes to get it. [Consults with Clerk] Yeah, we can't check it immediately, so we'll have to come back to it. Willow-Jean Prime.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN: PRIME: Thank you, Madam Chair. Given that you did not say that these are out of scope, I would like the Minister to answer my questions that I asked in terms of the consequential amendments to Schedule 2, which is the \"Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations 2023\" and, in particular, my questions around the \"local curriculum\". What does that actually mean in terms of these regulations? Can you please explain all of that in terms of \"local curriculum\" and the points that I made, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and—I'll add a couple to that, Madam Chair: did you consult with those schools—\n: CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): I didn't.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN: PRIME: The Minister—and those boards, and the whānau, hapū, iwi, mana whenua—your Treaty partners—on these changes that you're making to these regulations?\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Once again, for the member, the bit that she is talking about is being replaced. So she keeps mentioning the words \"local curriculum\"; I just draw to her attention that that part in Schedule 2 has been replaced by my Amendment Paper 428, so she should look at the Amendment Paper for the correct part. This is just a consequential amendment. We've already covered this in Part 1. All this does is take that and put it into the regulations as a consequential amendment. That's important to democracy, to make sure that our regulations and our legislation are the same.\n: Now, the member asked many, many, many questions and took the entire two hours to talk about this part. We've covered it at length and this is a consequential amendment, but I would like to draw her attention to the correct one that she should read from, which is in the Amendment Paper, which we have already voted on. It is no longer in scope.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I think one of the things that we were querying earlier was the fact that the Minister of Education mentioned that we have already voted on that. I think in terms of the voting part, this part on Schedule 2 will not be voted on until we conclude Schedule 2. So within the Schedule 2 from Amendment Paper 428 that the Minister is talking about, I do want to acknowledge the Minister for saying that it substantially changes what we're seeing in Schedule 2 of the amendment bill.\n: But it then also means that we should again examine this new Schedule 2 as a completely new thing that has not had the scrutiny of the Education and Workforce Committee. I think it is important for us to spend a little bit of time just to unpack the difference between why there has been such significant change between what is in the original Schedule 2 and what is in the amendment that the Minister released yesterday.\n: Now, in terms of replacement regulation 7(1)(f)(i), \"seeking to achieve\", that stays the same. We already covered the part about giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. I understand that that discussion has now drawn to a close. But I do want to check, and this is where my colleague the Hon Willow-Jean Prime is correct—when we say that what used to be in Schedule 2, in the select committee we changed \"local curriculum\" to \"teaching and learning programmes\". In replacement regulation 7(1)(f)(ii) of the Minister's amendment, that has changed completely.\n: More importantly, the references to local tikanga Māori and mātauranga Māori are now gone. That is significant in light of the fact that we are also removing the part on giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. So my first question to the Minister is: does Minister think that Te Tiriti o Waitangi or anything around that is only limited to te reo Māori? What was the Minister's rationale, then, to remove local tikanga Māori and mātauranga Māori from this particular section?\n: I'm going to leave that as this first question because I think this is quite a significant change from what is in the bill. Again, we are only able to debate on this for the first time today without any public consultation.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): I'm just going to repeat: this particular part of the bill was debated at length in earlier debates. The amendment has been voted on. What we are debating now are the consequential amendments to secondary legislation. We are not re-debating the issues that have been raised.\n: Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: Madam Chair.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Just a minute.\n: Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: Point of order. But Schedule 2 is within scope of Part 2, though, because it is under clause 30, which is Part 2.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): I think the member is starting to challenge my ruling. I just want to be clear, the amendments are to secondary legislation. It is not an opportunity to re-debate things that have already been voted on earlier today.\nCARL BATES (National—Whanganui): I move, That debate on this question now close.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That debate on this question now close.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15.\n: Motion agreed to.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendment to Part 2 set out on Amendment Paper 422 be agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendment be agreed to.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: Amendment not agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That Part 2 be agreed to.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15.\n: Part 2 agreed to.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that the Minister's amendment to Schedule 1 set out on Amendment Paper 364 be agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendment be agreed to.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15.\n: Amendment agreed to.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendment to Schedule 1 set out on Amendment Paper 424 be agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That amendment be agreed to.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: Amendment not agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That Schedule 1 as amended be agreed to.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: Schedule 1 as amended agreed to.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that the Minister's amendments to Schedule 2 set out on Amendment Papers 364 and 428 be agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendments be agreed to.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: Amendments agreed to.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendments to Schedule 2 set out on Amendment Paper 403 are out of order as being inconsistent with a previous decision of the committee.\n: Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendment to Schedule 2 set out on Amendment Paper 415 is out of order as being inconsistent with a previous decision of the committee.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That Schedule 2 as amended be agreed to.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: Schedule 2 as amended agreed to.\n: Clauses 1 to 3\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Members, we come now to our final debate. This is the debate on clauses 1 to 3: \"Title\", \"Commencement\", and \"Principal Act\".\nFRANCISCO HERNANDEZ (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I rise to take a call on the question of commencement, and drawing on your guidance earlier, am attempting to link some parts of the first part that were not adequately discussed, but very much linking it to the commencement date as per your recommendation.\n: Now, the commencement of this bill comes into force on the day after Royal assent and my questions are around whether this would apply to all parts of the bill, particularly clauses 11 and 12. These are the parts that confer additional responsibilities on the university councils, or does the Minister anticipate that there's like a transition period for the university councils to adopt these statements on freedom of expression? Because if it is the day after the commencement, are they expected to have it, like, straight away, or is there more of a kind of gradual transition period whereby the university councils will have time to devise, consult, and create these statements on freedom of expression? I do ask that because I do think some universities have already developed statements on freedom of expression, so that's not a problem with the commencement date, but others have not yet.\n: I guess, in terms of the interpretation on some of these things that we didn't get a chance to flesh out, what does the Minister anticipate in terms of the universities not being able to take public positions on matters? Does that mean that if a university was to take a stance on a public matter after the commencement date of this bill, they would get into trouble? Or if a submission has already been made to an existing legislation, but it was before the commencement date, does that mean that they won't get into trouble?\n: I'm just curious on the interaction of the commencement date and the requirement of the university to adopt statements of freedom of expression and how it interacts with them not being able to take public positions on matters, particularly as relates to the commencement date.\n: I think that it is really important to tease out what taking a public position on matters as institutions actually does refer to. Does it extend as far as curricula, for example?\n: Hon David Seymour: Maybe, but we've debated that.\nFRANCISCO HERNANDEZ: Well, \"maybe\"—exactly. Well, I mean, that would be terrible. If a university were to equally have to teach that creationism was as valid as, you know, the scientific theories of evolution, I think all members would agree that was a bad thing. So, I think it's really important to clarify what that actual relationship with the commencement date is and whether that retroactively applies to existing curricula and existing things that—\n: Hon David Seymour: Point of order. Madam Chair, these should have relevance. It's a very narrow question when the Act comes into force. I could help the member. If he looks at the relevant schedule, it's six months after the Act comes into force that the university must have a plan. The content of it has been debated in earlier parts.\nFRANCISCO HERNANDEZ: He's not the Minister, so—\n: CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The member still has the call.\nFRANCISCO HERNANDEZ: Great, thank you. Oh well, I appreciate the Minister's contribution.\n: Hon David Seymour: Well, sit down then.\nFRANCISCO HERNANDEZ: Well, I still have one minute left so—but I think that it is particularly important on what does apply with that six-month period commencement. Does that retroactively apply to existing curricula and existing past positions that the universities have already taken on statements? Are they required to retroactively pretend that they didn't have stances on certain issues to comply with this Government diktat, which, essentially, is forcing universities not to take positions on certain issues? Is there an element of retrospectivity with regard to that six-month commencement date that the honourable Minister very helpfully pointed out? Because, you know, I think it would be terrible if it were to retrospectively apply to existing past statements. Also, whether it applies to curricula as well, or whether it's just expected that public positions actually means statements or actual political positions, and it doesn't actually affect the teaching curricula of the university.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I also want to speak to the commencement date, clause 2—and I'm just signalling to the Chair, I won't take a full call because I would like to take a call later on the title. I want to check in terms of that, in conjunction with my Amendment Paper, Amendment Paper 402, which is to replace \"on the day after\" with \"six months after\". The reason I put this amendment together is mainly because of the fact that what we have seen, especially with the new amendment that has just come out this morning, it has caught school boards by surprise, is that there has been no indication that sufficient time has been given for school boards to be able to be compliant with the bill once the bill has been enacted. Unlike the section on universities, I haven't seen within this bill, anyway, and the Minister may like to speak to that, that allows school boards to be compliant with the new requirement—or at least shift towards the new requirement—once it has been enacted, if it's only the day after Royal assent. I think a six-month transition period is sensible for the schools to be able to do something like that, unless the Minister is suggesting that while the commencement date comes into force the day after Royal assent, school boards may not need to immediately be compliant or need to make the relevant changes that we see in this bill. So that's kind of one element.\n: I think the other element that we haven't had a chance to discuss and I think is quite significant is to do with how the commencement date is going to work with the Minister's Amendment Paper 364, on the changing of the composition of the Teaching Council. Now, this has raised significant concerns since this amendment has come out, and I want to check with the Minister, because I'm assuming the Minister isn't going to respond on whether this is actually considered now that the membership is dominated more so by Minister-appointed members, as opposed to independently elected. The Minister may or may not wish to address the fact of what that meant for the independence of the Teaching Council, which is a huge concern.\n: But, from a commencement date perspective, I want to check, once this bill comes into effect the day after Royal assent, at what point the Teaching Council will need to change its membership, noting that in section 486 of the Education and Training Act, the Teaching Council does have at least a mandate on how they are meant to do their nomination and process, but does it apply to the Minister-appointed members on that committee? I'm seeing a shaking of the head from officials.\n: Now, if the Minister wouldn't mind just elucidating this committee on how that particular election process and transition from an independent majority Teaching Council to a Minister-appointed majority Teaching Council is going to work after the commencement of this bill.\nCAMILLA BELICH (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. This is my first opportunity to make a contribution in this bill—regretfully at the latter stages of the debate, focused quite narrowly on the three clauses that we have remaining in front of us, and so I wanted to make a couple of comments around a few of those.\n: First of all, with the commencement. Now, this is not a bill that I have worked on at the Education and Workforce Committee at all. So when I was reading it today, I read the primary amendment piece of legislation, the Education and Training Amendment Bill (No 2), and I looked at it and tried to understand. I looked at the original piece of legislation that it's amending, which is the Education and Training Act, and tried to piece those two together. But, of course, as the House and the committee will be well aware, it's not possible to understand this particular Act by reading those two pieces of legislation and draft legislation because of the number of Amendment Papers that have been put forward.\n: I think this is relevant to clause 2—\"Commencement\"—because of the late nature of the two Amendment Papers, and the primary ones that I'm looking at are 364 and 428, which I'm not looking to debate at this stage. But I think that because they raise such significant changes to the bill that perhaps the Minister of Education could consider later commencement dates for the changes contained within those Amendment Papers.\n: For example, Amendment Paper 428, which looks to remove the Treaty clauses and instead replace that with other duties that could, for example—and I suggest this amendment to the Minister now—come in, say, \"one year after Royal assent\" as opposed to \"at Royal assent\", to give time for this to be socialised with the sector. Obviously, we haven't had a select committee stage; we haven't had the ability to hear submissions on this. We haven't had a particularly long committee stage, Madam Chair—that's not a criticism, that's just a reflection of the fact that committee stages are, by their nature, not perhaps the best way to scrutinise these. That would be a suggestion that I would make to clause 2 of the bill.\n: Also, in addition to that, obviously Amendment Paper 364. I was checking with my colleagues, and they said that a number of these changes haven't been traversed in relation to the Teaching Council that extensively. These were quite surprising changes that I saw reported in the media; that there was going to be a significant change to the way that the teaching profession was going to be regulated. There is a question, I think, as to whether it is appropriate for those significant changes to come in without a select committee process, without the chance to socialise that, not only with the Teaching Council, those employed by the Teaching Council, those affected by the changes to the governance of the Teaching Council, those impacted in the wider education sector, the profession. I think that that would merit consideration of a later commencement date for those changes contained within Amendment Paper 364. I'd like the Minister, if possible, to comment on those.\n: In terms of the title, obviously there are other kind of probably not very realistic titles that I could suggest and are often suggested at this stage. It's not my intention at this stage—although perhaps maybe some other members would like to suggest some title changes that may be more reflective of this bill.\n: But actually, the fact that we've already had two Education and Training Amendment Acts this year, I think, warrants consideration of whether it should be changed to a title. Not a title which doesn't reflect the content of the bill, not a title which is a ridiculous suggestion, but something that actually reflects what this actually does. My suggestion to the Minister would be instead of the Education and Training Amendment Act (No 2) 2025, whether she would consider changing that to the \"Education (Removal of Teaching Council Provisions and Removal of Treaty Clauses) Amendment Bill\". Because that is what the bill actually does, and I wondered if the Minister would be able to seriously consider those suggestions around commencement and the appropriateness of the commencement of this—we've got such a short period of consultation—and also whether the title does, in fact, reflect the bill.\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): I'm not sure if the member Camilla Belich was here earlier when we were discussing the fact that we are giving schools a whole additional year to do their next strategic plan. The last bit we've just finished voting on moves that from 1 January next year to 1 January 2027, and so there is plenty of time for schools to look at the new section 127 and the new regulations, and then put them into their strategic plans. We've already discussed that.\n: In terms of the Teaching Council, it is a very minor change. It's just an additional person and we will make that change immediately, and so there's no reason for us to do that.\n: The member also suggested a change saying that, essentially, the bill is only about two things. The bill is a lot more than that. Unfortunately, members in this committee stage didn't ask any questions on any other part of the bill. That's why we didn't get to talk about it, and so it's really unfortunate. But there are a lot more things in the bill, and so I think that the bill's title should stay the same.\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. Just wanting to pick up on that point that the Minister of Education made. Just for absolute clarity for all of our schools and kura out there, are you saying that their current strategic plans which give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, which outline the things that I said earlier about the legislation, which have now been replaced with the strategies in your Amendment Paper—so for all of next year, their current strategic plans are the ones that they will be governing their schools in accordance with? Your changes are not required to come into effect until 2027, is that right? Could you just clarify for all those schools in their planning?\n: Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: Madam Chair.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): I'm going to call Lawrence Xu-Nan, but I can't hear a much more new material coming in.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for this opportunity, because I do want to address the title of this bill because I have a number of amendments to the title. But I want to, first, thank the Minister of Education for responding to my questions. That's very helpful. So thank you, Minister.\n: In terms of the title of the bill, we've heard previously from my colleague Camilla Belich that the title should reflect the bill, and this is the second education and training bill, not including the early childhood education reform bill that's coming up as well. But I think to capture everything, like the Minister suggested, my tabled amendment is to call it the \"Education and Training (Broad Objectives, Attendance, Teaching Councils, and Other Matters) Amendment Bill\", which does, in fact, capture everything and is inclusive of that.\n: But looking at the title, summing up what we have discussed in the committee stage today, there are things that I think are better reflected within the title, because one of the things that we have heard consistently is the fact that we are removing the giving effect to Te Tiriti in section 127 of the Act. We are removing, even in some of the supporting objectives, the idea of local tikanga Māori and mātauranga Māori. We are looking at the fact that te reo Māori for ākonga Māori in mainstream is only available should they ask for it, as opposed to the default.\n: So I think I would like the Minister to seriously consider my amendment, which is to call the bill the \"Education and Training (Recolonising Education) Amendment Bill\", because that's kind of what we're seeing here in terms of the amount of things that have been removed as part of this bill. It's really important when we do look at education, Minister, that we are looking at education that is appropriate in the context of the students and in the context of those who are learning and who are being educated in our system, because if they cannot find relevance in there, it is much harder for them to get the educational outcome that the Minister has mentioned throughout this committee stage.\n: So, in many ways, this is very similar to what we're seeing when we first start to learn about things like phonics, which the Minister has mentioned throughout this debate. When we're learning about our A, Bs, and Cs, we're learning that \"A is for Antelope, L is for Llama\", and those are kind of the things that, for some students, they may never see in their entire life. So how are students able to relate to that, how are students able to learn best from that if they cannot find the relevance? So my amendment that I would like the Minister to consider is changing the title to the \"Education and Training (Antelopes and Llamas) Amendment Bill\".\n: Finally, I would like the Minister to consider the fact that when we're looking at the packaging of the changes to section 127 with the removal of giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, we are looking at the changes that we are making to the Teaching Council. We are looking at the fact that we're introducing a redundant piece of legislation on freedom of expression, as many universities already have a policy on that. A better title of this bill is the \"Education and Training (Atlas's Puppet) Amendment Bill\".\nCARL BATES (National—Whanganui): I move, That debate on this question now close.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That debate on this question now close.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: Motion agreed to.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendment to clause 1 to insert \"(Board Objectives, Attendance, Teaching Council and Other Matters)\" be agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendment be agreed to.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: Amendment not agreed to.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's remaining amendments to clause 1 are out of order as not being an objective description of the bill.\n: The Hon Willow-Jean Prime's 14 tabled amendments to clause 1 are out of order as not being an objective description of the bill.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That clause 1 be agreed to.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: Clause 1 agreed to.\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendment to clause 2 set out on Amendment Paper 402 be agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendment be agreed to.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: Amendment not agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That clause 2 be agreed to.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: Clause 2 agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That clause 3 be agreed to.\n: New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: Clause 3 agreed to.\n: Bill to be reported with amendment.",

        "topic": "In Committee",
        "content": ": Part 1  Consent to distribute medicines by verification\nCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Members, we come now to the Medicines Amendment Bill. We start with Part 1, which is the debate on clauses 4 to 10, \"Consent to distribute medicines by verification\". The question is that Part 1 stand part.\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. It's nice to see this bill enter the committee stage and to see it come through with many improvements made by the Health Committee. We're always grateful for the opportunity to be able to participate in panel beating the bill at select committee.\n: I'd like to ask the Minister some questions tonight. The first one, I'd like to link to the original policy intent of the bill. Clause 4, the \"consent by verification\", which is the main innovation in this bill: I'd like to hear from the Minister why this consent by verification and the verification pathway applies to new medicines, and what is meant by a \"new\" medicine. What about other already approved medicines that might have a minor change, like a change in their presentation, or a minor change in their formulation that doesn't require a full evidence review? Why is that not part of the verification pathway, given that, on the surface, you'd think those would be lower-risk types of changes and, perhaps, more frequent than the need to actually verify new medicines?\n: I would appreciate it if the Minister could expand on why this consent by verification pathway only applies to new medicines.\nHon PEENI HENARE (Labour): Tēnā koe, Madam Chair, and thank you very much. It's one of those bills where specifics matter, and I'm curious—and if the Minister wouldn't mind answering some of the questions I have—around the recognised regulatory authorities. That's in clause 7. It goes on to talk about, as a regulator of medicine—and it lists those that it has in there. I wonder if that might include, to the Minister's reckoning, or at least to the Minister's consideration, some of the work that the important ethics committees and others might do in that space, with respect to the medicines. If the Minister wouldn't mind giving some thought to whether or not they perhaps could be included, either now or at a later date, with respect to making sure that we have recognised regulatory authorities.\n: The other matter I wanted to raise is, in clause 6, the following particulars are required, and it goes down to the letter \"(m) the name and address of the place or places where the manufacture, preparation, or packing is intended to be carried out.\" The reason I ask that question is that a number of concerned members of the public who have travelled widely around the world know that, in some countries, they repackage goods, even give them different names, but in effect they are still the same thing. Yet they want to be sure that, when these types of matters are raised and medicines are brought into this country, the origin of those particular medicines, of both its manufacture and of course its preparation and packaging, is clear and is well understood for those in New Zealand. At the moment, those regulations are pretty tight. What we're concerned about is any loosening of those matters could cause some confusion about the types of medicines that those people might be gaining access to. Some clarification from the Minister on those particular matters will be helpful.\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. My colleague has picked up on clause 6, so another question in relation to clause 6, which lists the contents of an application under the verification pathway. I'd like the Associate Minister of Health David Seymour to explain how these requirements interact with the common documentation system used by some of the regulators we are likely to recognise. There's a number of specifics here that all seem very logical from the perspective of approving a particular medicine, but we've been told repeatedly at the Health Committee that there's the potential for great efficiency through the use of standardised documentation when these applications are made—or applications for the Minister's consent, as it's called in this bill. So we'd like to understand how requirements (a) through to (m) interact with the standardised documentation system.\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd just like to support the vote of confidence in this bill from my colleague the Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall, who really gave it some good scrutiny at the Health Committee. I think it's important to note that, in the broader constitutional policy space, there is quite a shift of power from legal, prescriptive sorts of requirements through to empowering Ministers to act through notices and rules, and I do think that raises a number of legal questions. While I accept that it improves the agility of being able to get medicines out faster, there are questions around parliamentary scrutiny, and there are questions about the transparency of Gazette notices, and also how section 22 in particular interacts legally with new section 22A.\n: I'll just go through them in turn, and I'm happy to either have a longer contribution or do some quick-fire. We do recognise that delegation and flexibility are important, because medicines are the new frontier for being able to get people well faster, and potentially save a lot of money around more invasive procedures, like operations. We do accept that there are efficiency gains, in that there will be a reduction of duplication of effort, consistent with our trade and health cooperation frameworks with Australia. I think where the rubber hits the road, though, is around the dependence on secondary legislation, and there are operational details, such as time lines, data requirements, verification procedures, that will only exist in future rules, not in primary legislation. That produces a kind of layered legal dependency, where the rights and obligations of applicants hinge on rules that are not yet drafted.\n: That's tricky; I'd be keen to hear the Minister's views on how he sees that interplay and the certainty that will be afforded, particularly if applicants are going to be questioning some of the applicant decisions—how those sections 22 and 22A will interplay, because, once again, we find ourselves in the House where we are subordinating to secondary legislation quite a bit of the devil in the detail. That will be important, we want to support that, but we need to know that there will be due diligence given to ensure that there isn't uncertainty for those who apply, because that could have a chilling effect on the market, and that the rules are really clear from the outset, even though we have this kind of parallel stream of how the Medicines Act is going to work.\n: I will have more questions later about regulatory capture and the medicines regulations and some of the constitutional implications, but I'd just like the Minister to answer those if he may.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): I'd like to thank members for their questions so far, and I'll try and address each of them in turn. Ayesha Verrall asked about clause 4 and specifically the words \"new medicine\": why would a new indication, or perhaps a minor change, to a medicine not be able to access this verification pathway, which the words \"new medicine\" might suggest that it couldn't? I'm advised that, in actual fact, a new medicine, a new use—i.e., a major change to a medicine—would be captured as a \"new medicine\" for the purpose of this bill, whereas a minor change would be already notified. So, in other words, if a change is significant enough to require consent, then it is a new medicine, even though there might be something very much like it already consented.\n: Peeni Henare asked two questions, one about clause 7, and he asked a question about whether an ethics committee could also be involved in authorising a medication. I don't intend it to go any further than the bill right now. He asked if we might in the future—that's certainly quite possible. But the point here is to rely on trusted nations' consent authorities—and those trusted nations are set out in secondary legislation—rather than introduce any new pathways through other bodies, besides what I've just described.\n: He also asked about replacement section 21(2)(m)—for motel—inserted by clause 6: the name of the place and why is this necessary. He pointed out that one of the dangers with medication is that what it says on the label might not be what's there. A lot of Medsafe's work is ensuring that what you read on the label is actually what's in there, and it's certainly true that some medicines are manufactured and packaged in parts of the world that might not have the same sort of ethics and standards that we're used to in New Zealand. So that's why it's actually important that they identify where will this be packaged and manufactured, so that we do have oversight—or Medsafe can have oversight, rather—not only of what does it say it is, but what actually is it.\n: Ayesha Verrall then asked about clause 6, inserting replacement section 21(2), and how these requests interact with the common document system used by other countries. In other words, are the requirements listed in paragraphs (a) to (m) of section (21)(2) going to mesh well with the common technical dossier—I think that was the point of the question. I'm advised that, yes, it will. The company needs to provide the full data dossier, which is standardised internationally, and that has been thought of.\n: Finally, Ingrid Leary asked about what she says is a shift of power towards Ministers. It's certainly true that it talks about a Minister granting consent. That, at a constitutional, technical level, may be true, but, ultimately, this decision making is not done by a Minister; it's done in their name. It's done by people with far more appropriate qualifications in pharmacology—than most people who have held the role of Minister—in this legislation.\n: In terms of the question about accountability and stability—and I was pleased to hear about, you know: how do we make sure that there's certainty for people who are applicants? I just make the point that any rules, made under this law, that will set out how it operates do need to be presented to the House and are subject to disallowance by Parliament. So, under our normal conventions, we maintain parliamentary oversight, and there'll also be consultation with affected people prior to making any of these rules. So I hope that addresses the questions that have been asked so far.\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): Thank you to the Associate Minister of Health for his answers. I'd like to talk about new section 22AA in clause 7. The Health Committee's view was that it was a helpful change to the bill to, rather than specify the regulators in primary legislation, specify criteria about which overseas regulators would be able to be recognised. We think that that's a positive, helpful change, and we're pleased to see it reflected in the bill now.\n: I want to draw the Minister's attention to the revocation of recognition of an authority. I would like the Minister to expand on what type of circumstances he imagines an authority's recognition might be revoked, and any elaboration he can provide based on advice he's received on that.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I just have two quick questions for the Minister regarding clause 6, inserting new section 21(2).\n: The first question I have—and this is partly because one of my degrees is actually in pharmacology—is on subsection (2)(h), \"reports of toxicological, pharmacological, and clinical studies that support the application:\". I want to check with the Minister whether there is a requirement for that particular study to be conducted or to be peer reviewed as well. The reason I mention that is because there have been instance where, particularly in the chase for funding for toxicological or pharmacological studies, peer review hasn't been done as much or as well. That is something I want to check with the Minister: whether there is a requirement.\n: The second thing is around subsection (2)(k), in terms of the distribution in any country other than New Zealand, and also, this plays into \"approved or consented to by the appropriate authorities in that country\" but also potentially recognises the regulatory authority that has been touched on previously in clause 7, which inserts new section 22AA. My question is whether there have been any safeguards considered by the Minister on what happens in the event that, or how do we potentially vet if, a particular appropriate authority or authority in that country has been susceptible to undue industrial or political pressure. Those are my two initial questions.\nRICARDO MENÉNDEZ MARCH (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. So my question was in relationship to new section 22AA(1)(e), inserted by clause 7. This is in relationship to the recognised regulatory authorities. One of the requirements that's been set out in the legislation is for those to conduct their business and release reports in English. I wanted to ask whether the Minister for Regulation thinks that that may potentially hinder the ability for us to access medicines where the business may be conducted in another language.\n: The reason why I ask this as well is because we do have, in replacement section 21(2)(j), inserted by clause 6, that, for example, translations may be provided when it comes to the applications for the Minister's consent. So in clause 6, there's this acknowledgment that translations can play a part in enabling good decision-making, but then in new section 22AA, there is the sort of much more tight requirement for the business of these entities to be conducted in English without, I guess, being able to accommodate, for example, resources to translate necessary documents to English in order to be able to broaden the range of recognised regulatory bodies that the Government can tap into so that people can have greater access to medicines.\n: So my question to the Minister is whether he thinks that new section 22AA(1)(e) unnecessarily narrows the recognised regulatory authorities, particularly in relationship to the way that clause 6 has been written. Thank you.\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd just like to ask a further supplementary question based on the question raised by the Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall regarding the revocation or designation of a recognised authority. Normally, ministerial decisions are not subject to explicit procedural safeguards. If it's in the Gazette and a decision has been made, normally there are notice and comment requirements beyond publication. So my first question to the Minister on that natural justice and transparency issue is: are there other forms of contesting decisions either with designation or revocation, except via judicial review, which we know is incredibly expensive and again could have a chilling effect on the market?\n: I wouldn't mind turning also to—just for some clarity, I think really for the Hansard, because I did raise this previously—the relationship between section 22 and the amendment. If there is a question of which one supersedes, because there are two pathways, it would be good to know what is the primary section out of those? If there are two pathways, if there are inconsistent rules, which rules under those two pathways should supersede?\n: I've got another question, too, just around the administrative burden, because with the gazetting of notices which are required—so they recognise or they revoke authorities—it could create some transitional uncertainty for applicants. Is there an efficient way of doing that or is that just going to be a constant stream of Gazette notices?\n: The other one is: could legal challenges arise where a medicine has been approved under one recognition regime and then is later affected by revocation? Probably, again, the \"hierarchy\" is the word I was looking for in terms of which of the two streams that they can be approved under would take precedence.\n: I think there is also another question that is similar but different to the one raised by the Green member around localised safety assessment. Where the Minister may revoke consents, the process relies on post market intervention rather than pre-market evaluation, and that can have inherent public risk if adverse effects arise later. What are the mitigations for that risk, particularly because that is a localised situation and those conditions may have changed within the New Zealand market, but may not necessarily have come up from an external market?\n: That's probably all my questions, but they are important legal questions if we are to see this legislation actually reap the full financial and health benefits to New Zealand that it is touted to do.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): I thank members for this latest batch of questions. I appreciate Ayesha Verrall saying that this is a positive change that the countries, or at least the regulators of the countries, that will be deemed equivalent or valid for the assurance pathway—that that is going to be set in secondary legislation, rather than hard-wired into this law. Then she asked a question about revocation. The test is whether the regulator continues to meet the criteria set out in paragraphs (a) to (e) of new section 22AA(1) in clause 7. If it starts failing to meet those, then it would be revoked, and so those are the criteria set out in the legislation.\n: Lawrence Xu-Nan asked about the credibility of toxicological, pharmacological, and clinical studies. They're peer-reviewed by the regulator who has given consent overseas, and so I guess that the point is that if we've—these questions sort of go together. If the overseas regulator is approved, then one of the criteria for that is that we can trust that they rely on good science, and, of course, if they rely on good science, that probably answers Lawrence Xu-Nan's question.\n: With regard to new section 21(2)(k) in clause 6, there was a question about proof that it's been consented elsewhere. It really is as simple as being able to demonstrate credibly that the consent overseas truly exists, and so it's a fairly mechanical, administrative thing.\n: Ricardo Menéndez March raised an interesting question about: does limiting ourselves to English-speaking jurisdictions restrict the possible range of overseas agencies that we could rely on for verification? Potentially, but I think that members might be surprised. For example, I asked about Japan. I've been informed that the Japanese consenting authority actually conducts its business in English, and so that's a significant country with its own language that none the less uses English to work with the rest of the world. There may be countries that conduct their business in other languages, but there are certainly enough countries who do their medical consenting in English that I think that there's a big enough pool for this policy to work very well.\n: Then Ingrid Leary asked a series of questions about the natural justice of revocation, and whether there could be peer review or other ways to challenge that. I think that it's important to recognise, simply, that in the part that she talked about, she's talking about whether or not—as I understand it—a particular country can be recognised for their consenting agency, rather than a particular applicant. It's true that a country might be offended that we no longer recognise them, but that in itself is, I don't think, a reason to have a major bootstraps, belt and braces approach to natural justice where New Zealand's Government will choose countries that it thinks it can rely on for this pathway.\n: There was a question about a hierarchy between the usual consenting pathway and the new rule-of-two consenting pathway. For a starting answer—and I might need to get more advice about this, because she also asked what would happen if a medicine fails at one pathway but succeeds at another. I would start by saying that the purpose is that if you have consent through either of them, it must be adequate, but we certainly would not retrospectively revoke. Then there was a question of could there be a—actually, I've addressed the question of the legal challenge against revocation.\n: There was, finally, a question about localised safety assessments, and are there problems where there might be local conditions where the population—if I understood her question correctly, the population in New Zealand has different needs or vulnerabilities from those in other countries. I would just make the point that most countries have quite diverse populations within their borders. By the time you've got two other countries that have consented a medication, I suspect that you'd find that, actually, they've covered enough bases so that it's safe in New Zealand, particularly considering that one of the criteria for considering if you want to keep doing business with someone is to ask whether they have robust systems. So I hope that addresses the questions asked today.\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): Thank you. I'd now like to ask the Minister some questions about the development of his policy thinking in this area. In particular, I have been studying the coalition agreement between the National and the ACT Party, which is referenced in the regulatory impact statement (RIS). The commitment that's relevant to this bill was to require Medsafe to approve new pharmaceuticals within 30 days of them being approved by at least two overseas regulatory agencies recognised by New Zealand. I read that and I interpret that as automatic approval, and yet, that's not what this bill does. This bill still requires a sponsor to make an application. So it is not the case that we'd have a very efficient system where just with approval in two jurisdictions, there will be a requirement for automatic approval. Instead, it requires a sponsor, usually the pharmaceutical company, and the application to be made.\n: My first question to the Minister is why has the thinking, with respect to how this bill will operate, changed from what was envisaged in the coalition agreement and what's in the bill now? I'm interested to know how he thinks that change will impact the efficiency benefits that will come from this bill, because the purpose of the bill is to speed up the approvals of new medicines in New Zealand, and, of course, as a result of the change between what's envisaged in the coalition agreement and the bill that we have now, there will be fewer medicines being considered through this pathway. In particular, one of the things that comes into play—because of the way the bill we're debating is crafted—is the incentives that apply to a sponsor. Now, in the original version that wasn't relevant, but it is now, in the way that this bill is constructed.\n: We heard at select committee that a number of incentives operate on sponsors, including that they make judgments on the likelihood of their bill achieving Pharmac funding in New Zealand. They'll think, \"Well, is it really worth our while to put something through a process when\"—perhaps, they would say—\"unlikely to get it funded.\" That makes me wonder, well, will this bill have the actual impacts that were promised when it was proposed? I'd like to hear the Minister's explanation of how impactful he thinks it will be in light of those changes.\nHon PEENI HENARE (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair. I'm going to speak to clause 7, 22B(4) and just ask for a bit of clarification, so this won't take very long: \"The Director-General may issue the applicant with 1 or more invoices for any fee payable under regulations in respect of the application.\" Is that only those that are successful? Does that include those that are declined? Is there an opportunity to see a schedule of what those fees may look like? Is there transparency around those particular invoices we can expect to be made public to allow us the confidence that there's consistency in their fees framework?\n: So just some clarification around that. I know it seems relatively small in the scheme of things, but I just think that when we look towards the way that those who access the ability for consideration as medicines that it's made very clear what those fees do look like, and whether or not those include those that are accepted as well as the ones that are declined.\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): My colleagues have talked about the drivers, if you like, of efficiency with the system and how that will look compared to the original coalition agreement. I think, extrapolating on that, there is a real potential for a streamlined process to reduce scrutiny of pharmaceutical submissions if the decision making becomes overly reliant on the second stream. We don't have any control over that or influence over that. There are jurisdictions that we compare ourselves to that have far more lobbying and political influence in their system. Conceivably, there may be two or more jurisdictions with very big pharma companies—just as there are with tobacco companies, actually—where a concerted effort is made to promote things that may not necessarily be consistent with New Zealand public interest standards.\n: If there is a two-tier system and they both function, that's probably not much of a problem, but if the second tier becomes the predominant way of getting pharmaceuticals through to New Zealand, I think it does raise real questions about the drivers and the safeguards. So I'm really just wanting some reassurance that the New Zealand public interest standards are met through whatever rules come out, which have not yet been written, and that we don't see a kind of tail wagging the dog, where the whole sector then becomes beholden to international commercial interests that don't necessarily serve New Zealand public interest standards.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you, Minister, for responding to my previous questions. I have two more questions for the Minister. The first one is something the Minister said, and it kind of ties into new section 22C(1)(b)(v) as well. I think the Minister was saying that in terms of some of the pharmacological or clinical studies that have been done in other countries, other countries also have a diverse population in order to be able to test some of that. Two authorities have approved that, and it should, again, be safe enough here. But I think one of the things I would be interested to know about—certain countries, most of the other countries, don't have the same data on the indigenous population of Aotearoa, and also, potentially, Pacific populations.\n: So, you know, looking at new section 22C(1)(b)(v), when it talks about contextualising \"the benefit-risk profile of the medicine due to local disease epidemiology, public health considerations\", I do wonder, in those sorts of considerations: does the Minister consider that while we do have a diverse population, some of that interaction, particularly when we're looking at it from a pharmacological context, may not have been tested here? So I just want to check; the Minister may already have a response to that.\n: The second part is around new section 22D, noting that there is a lot of ministerial authority in this bill, and we're looking at the rules for Minister's consent by verification. I wanted to check with the Minister: when we are looking at things that are done by Order in Council and when there is secondary legislation, did the Minister, as always, consider some sort of review clause in terms of how the Minister may make rules setting out some of that requirement, or is there something that will be done, in terms of a review of those rules, on a more ad hoc or need basis?\n: In terms of the rules, as we are always concerned about, in terms of any potential overreach or potential \"Henry VIII\" clause, I think having something of a review clause would also be another level of safeguard that can be protected when it comes to particularly consent by verification. So those are my two questions.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): I thank members for further questions. Ayesha Verrall asked about the perceived difference between the ACT - National confidence and supply agreement and the workings of this legislation. As a Minister, I'm not actually responsible for political agreements. All I would say is that I'm a very thoughtful and receptive Minister who's always prepared to make the legislation work in the best interests of all New Zealand. I'll also just make the point that having an applicant, as the member asked, demonstrates that there is a company that will take responsibility for the supply chain within New Zealand. So that is a worthwhile benefit in my view.\n: Peeni Henare asked about what fees these foreign pharmaceutical companies might be charged. I have to say that I'm heartened by the Labour member's concern for foreign pharmaceutical companies; it's a new development, but not an unwelcome one. The fees will be published, they'll be set by regulation, and they will be transparent. But they're not currently set, so that will come as a consequence of the law of passing, if the Parliament decides to pass it.\n: Ingrid Leary repeated the question by Ayesha Verrall and then also asked about the lobbying and political influence on overseas consenting agencies. All I would say is that if you imagine a place like, say, Switzerland, which was in the original bill, or if you imagine a place like the EU or the United Kingdom, your mind doesn't immediately think, I'm sure, that their consenting authorities consent dangerous medicines because of undue influence. I think that would be a surprising thing to most people; there's no evidence to believe that is the case. All of those jurisdictions do have much greater access to medicines than New Zealand and that is one of the things that we are trying to fix here.\n: Going back to Ayesha Verrall, she also asked if it might be that because companies are unlikely to—well, she posits that companies are unlikely to apply for consent if they don't believe they'll ultimately get Pharmac funding. That may be a calculation for some companies, but at the margin what we're doing here is making the consenting process easier and quicker. So you would expect the net effect of that to increase medicines' availability. Of course, any company coming to the New Zealand market will be asking themselves \"Will people actually buy it?\", but that's a commercial decision for them, not one that we can control.\n: Then we had Lawrence Xu-Nan asking about Māori and Pacific populations. But he also, helpfully, answered his own question by pointing to new section 22C(1)(b)(v), inserted by clause 7, where he pointed out that the Minister can consent a medicine if he believes or she believes it \"does not require independent assessment … to contextualise the benefit-risk profile of the medicine due to local disease epidemiology, public health considerations, or New Zealand specific health risks;\". So that is actually covered.\n: Finally, Lawrence Xu-Nan asked if there would be a review clause. Much secondary legislation—I expect all secondary legislation—will be made in best practice.\nDr HAMISH CAMPBELL (National—Ilam: ): I move, That debate on this question now close.\n: Motion agreed to.\n: Part 1 agreed to.\n: Part 2  Other amendments\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Members, we come now to Part 2, the debate on clauses 11 to 13, \"Other amendments\", and the Schedule. The question is that Part 2 stand part.\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair. I want to specifically refer to the Minister's Amendment Paper, which was not considered by the select committee. I'd like to take the opportunity to ask the Minister to engage in some back and forth, if we may, on the content of this amendment.\n: CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Encouraged by the Chair.\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL: Minister, what does your amendment do? [Member knocks over her glass of water]\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): Look, I realise that the Chamber can get exciting at this time of night. The amendment simply allows a promoter of a medical conference—you can imagine a place where the primary audience is people who are registered as clinicians under the health practitioners assurance legislation. If you're holding such a conference, then you can get consent to advertise medicines that are not currently consented by Medsafe. The reason that you would want to do that is that clinicians go to these sorts of conferences, in part, precisely because they would like to find out about medicines that are new. Presently, our laws actually forbid those medicines being advertised, and the practical result of that is that doctors—I even happen to know some—go to nice places like Fiji or Noosa, to go to these conferences and learn about the latest and best medicines emerging in the world, and they take their money with them. I've seen one estimate, and if I recall off the top of my head, the net benefit to New Zealand of allowing these medical conferences to happen here in New Zealand will be around about $90 million.\n: It's very simple. We're aligning our rules with the places that New Zealand doctors are currently going. So, instead of going to Noosa or Fiji, they can stay somewhere nice, like Auckland, and learn about new medicines.\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): In the spirit of back and forth, thank you to the Minister for that answer. Why is the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act used to define which professions or regulated practitioners in the Act. Their conferences are the ones that are covered by this amendment. Why is that done and is it relevant to the operation of this clause that in an international conference many visitors from overseas won't be regulated by that Act, because they will be registered overseas?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Minister for Regulation): First of all, why would we use the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act? Because that is the piece of legislation in New Zealand that defines the professions that you might think of—doctors, clinicians, the kinds of people that you would imagine you would want to learn about new medicines. It seems like a tidy way to do it.\n: The member is correct that there might be people coming from overseas inbound to learn about medicines at conferences in New Zealand, but I would interpret this as those people are people who come under the same professions and, indeed, would be regulated under that Act if they were in New Zealand. Of course, in this instance they wouldn't be, but they're equivalents. They just happen to be from overseas.\n: Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Mr Chair, just to conclude this—\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O: 'Connor): Dr Ayesha Verrall—I'll facilitate this.\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): This concern about medical conferences was raised in the course of the last Parliament's debate on the Therapeutic Products Bill, so can the Minister explain why this amendment has appeared in the bill now? Why wasn't it in the original bill that was drafted and considered and went to select committee? Why did the Minister's intention with respect to this concern, which has been well known about for some time, change? Perhaps the Minister would like to elaborate on the prospects of a medicinal products bill. Has the prospect of a medicinal products bill passing in this Parliament declined, and is that why this amendment is going through with this bill?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): Well, first of all, I regularly receive praise for having a range of fine qualities, but not in this sense. So why would we not put this in the bill initially? Because we were preparing a bill primarily for the purpose for the rule of two. Once it was brought to my attention that it would be useful for New Zealand clinicians to be able to have medical conferences with advertised medicines in New Zealand, I made a judgment that it was well worth enabling that at the earlier opportunity, which is this bill.\n: The Minister—it's not really part of this debate; if she wants to speculate if there is now not going to be a medical products bill. I wouldn't speak for my colleague Casey Costello, who has that responsibility, but I wouldn't underestimate her either.\nRICARDO MENÉNDEZ MARCH (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. Some follow-up questions on the amendment which, Ayesha Verrall noted, was introduced without select committee scrutiny.\n: I noted that the Minister mentioned that such conferences—if I heard correctly—were to bring $90 million to the country. Can I just test where that figure came from, and who produced the analysis on that amount of money? Also whether, as part of that, there was any distributional analysis of, I guess, where that money goes into in terms of who benefits from that?\n: The other question I had in relationship to the amendment was that it seems to me like this is obviously something that had been considered for a while, but can the Minister list the range of stakeholders or entities that have been consulted, if at all, to prepare this amendment? Because, again, we've heard feedback from the Minister in his initial remarks around some of the bodies which he talked about wanting this, but can I check what official engagements happened to produce this amendment, if any? Also, additionally, at what dates did the Minister start the work to prepare this amendment—because that's an important part of the question in relationship to Ayesha Verrall's point, which is that if this had been considered for quite some time, why was this not flagged at the select committee stage?\n: So, to recap, I'm interested to know where the $90 million figure came from; the distributional analysis for benefits; additionally, the list of stakeholders or entities that were consulted; as well as the issue of the date that the Minister started to prepare this amendment.\n: A follow-up question on that would be in relationship to the list of stakeholders and entities that would have been consulted with. Did he receive any feedback of which regional centres in our country are most likely to benefit from these medical conferences, if at all?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): As I said at the time, the $90 million was a figure off the top of my head. I'm not relying on that to justify this change, and I don't want to start quoting if I might misquote. But it is a figure that I've heard and share in candour with the committee.\n: As far as the distributional analysis is concerned, I also don't have that. I only have the headline figure. In terms of consultation, I haven't directly consulted people with this. I've had it proposed—the ministry's recommended it—and I believe that if we can remove a restriction that will make sure that people can do more to make New Zealand a wealthier and more interesting place, then we should do that.\n: In terms of the date, I started thinking about it. I couldn't give you an exact date off the top of my head but I'd be happy to talk to the member later if he is really interested in that.\nRICARDO MENÉNDEZ MARCH (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. I'm a little bit concerned to hear that the $90 million was kind of made up on the spot. I guess the question I had in relationship to that—or from the top of his head—is whether he asked any Government body to do some analysis on that figure? I can totally accept that, maybe, he just doesn't have a thought in his head, but I do want to know whether he actually asked his officials to explore exactly how much revenue it could bring. It's OK if that figure is not in front of him, but I do want to ask whether that question was part of the process to get this amendment sorted.\n: The reason why I ask this is because the bill, so far, has had quite constructive cross-party consensus. I would hope that this amendment and the way that this is presented also seeks to do that very same thing. But without having clarity of exactly the robust analysis that was being made from the Minister to corroborate, for example, the amount of revenue it could bring to the country, it's hard for us to be able to quantify the benefits of this amendment.\n: To recap, I'm interested to know if he did actually ask for any advice on the amount of money such an amendment and these medical conferences could bring to the country; and if he did not commission such advice, then what basis is he using to get to a point where he feels confident about the amount of money that such an amendment will bring to the country?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): I can only repeat my previous comment. The justification for this does not rely on any specific figure. If it was $9 million, $90 million, or $900 million, it costs next to nothing to do, and it increases people's freedom to do as they please within New Zealand so long as there are no risks to others, and, therefore, we should do it.\nTOM RUTHERFORD (National—Bay of Plenty): I move, That debate on this question now close.\n: Motion agreed to.\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): The question is that the Minister's amendments set out on Amendment Paper 425 be agreed to.\n: A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendments be agreed to.\n: New Zealand National 49; New Zealand Labour 34; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.\n: Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.\n: Amendments agreed to.\n: Part 2 as amended agreed to.\n: Clauses 1 to 3\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Members, we come now the debate on clauses 1 to 3—title, commencement, and principal Act.

We begin with the debate on Part 1. This is the debate on clauses 3 to 15, Amendments to the Crimes Act 1961. The question is that Part 1 stand part.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. I want to start by going clause to clause, because there are quite a few things to unpack. I want to start with clause 4, which inserts section 2A, \"Meaning of person who owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand\".\n: One of things we had a question on—and it's one of the things we've been trying to tease out in the select committee—is the broader idea of what it means when someone owes allegiance to a particular location. This came up when we were talking about someone, for example, who may not have the citizenship of a particular country but at the same time has whakapapa to a particular country and as part of the whakapapa may experience of may express certain intentions or feelings, and whether they are going to be captured in this legislation.\n: It is something that is complex, considering we heard in the previous bills that we do have very diverse communities here in Aotearoa, and the Greens have some concerns around the definition we see here, for example, in section 2A(3)(c), because I think it takes a very pure form of definition that doesn't take in broader complexities of the whakapapa of the person, or the heritage or the ancestry of the person. So I just want to check with the Minister to start off with, on some of that consideration as he develops this bill and the intentions behind it.\nHon PAUL GOLDSMITH (Minister of Justice): This legislation is not changing our citizenship laws or making amendments in any of those areas. What it does do is create new offences relating to foreign interference in the Crimes Act. Just by way of introduction, it's a bill that would create an offence if a person engages in covert, deceptive, coercive, or corruptive conduct on behalf of a foreign power to intentionally compromise a protected New Zealand interest, or is reckless as to whether their conduct is likely to compromise such an interest, or commits an imprisonable offence to intentionally benefit a foreign power, or is reckless as to whether committing that offence is likely to provide such a benefit. So that's the primary focus.\n: What we're trying to do here is to deal with the reality. A lot of people would seek to deny that there is a problem, but the Government is firmly of the view that foreign interference is something that we are concerned about as a nation. So we're updating our legislation to be clear about that. What we're not doing is changing our citizenship laws.\nHon Dr DUNCAN WEBB (Labour—Christchurch Central): Thank you, Mr Chair. I'll pick up where my friend and colleague Lawrence Xu-Nan left off, on clause 4, new section 2A, which does touch on the slightly arcane subject of the meaning of a person who \"owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand\". This is, basically, a loyalty question in the old-fashioned sense of the word—that is to say, for someone who owes allegiance to the Crown, under this legislation it is a criminal offence to work against the interests of the Crown.\n: Whilst the Minister noted that this doesn't change immigration law—I accept that—there is an interface between immigration status and who owes allegiance to the Crown. One thing that is clear here is that anyone who is a citizen owes allegiance to the Crown, but, from the legislation, it's not immediately clear to me—and I'd appreciate the Minister's elucidation; I see he's flying solo tonight, which is probably a good thing—about other immigration statuses. In new section 2A(3)(c), it says, \"[any person] not bound by the oath of allegiance:\". Essentially, you can't be found guilty of this offence. There is a series of categories of people. One would be a person on a resident's visa. Is a person on a resident's visa bound by the oath of allegiance? Is a person on a worker's visa bound by the oath of allegiance?\n: I think, when we get down to the categories where it's clearly not the case—for example, someone on a visitor or tourist visa, who, if they engaged in what are, essentially, subversive activities, would not be criminally responsible for foreign interference, because they're not bound by the oath of allegiance. But the one a little bit higher up from the tourist and visitor visas—workers, Recognised Seasonal Employers workers, or people on perhaps a two- or three-year worker's visa—if they engage in activities which are there to benefit a foreign State by deception, which is at the root of this, as we'll come to, would a person on a worker's visa or a resident's visa be subject to this legislation, or are they persons who owe allegiance to the Sovereign of New Zealand?\n: It would be really appreciated if the Minister could give some elucidation there, because, ultimately, I think we accept that if people come into New Zealand and they're on a pathway to residence—ultimately, a pathway to citizenship, which is the highest status, including residency—we expect them to be loyal, ultimately, because this is what this legislation is at root about, to New Zealand. If they come from a foreign country, wherever that might be, which has different interests and wants to undermine New Zealand's economic or security interests and they want to, I don't know, pass information back to the other State or to engage in conduct that undermines the interests of New Zealand, as workers or with an immigration status other than that of citizen, ultimately the question is this: are they captured by this?\n: If they're not, there's quite a hole here. Look, if you're a spy—let's say what this is about—and you're a resident but not a citizen, you've got a free pass; you'll continue passing information and undermining the interests of New Zealand in the interests of the other State with pretty much impunity. I think it would be really good if the Minister could go through and say, \"Here's where the line is. Here is where you owe allegiance to New Zealand, and here's where you don't.\" That would be a really helpful elucidation by the Minister.\nVANUSHI WALTERS (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair. I have some new and different questions for the Minister, but they are about the same new section 2A. This is the section about who owes allegiance. During the course of submissions, the New Zealand Law Society wrote a lot on this section and asked several questions, some of which were addressed by the amended version of the bill, but some weren't. I just thought I would use the opportunity to get the Minister's clarification on where he thinks these situations would fall.\n: The first is: who counts as a person in the context of the Ross Dependency? There are potential difficulties with the reference to persons in New Zealand due to the need to reconcile respective sections in the Crimes Act and the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977 definitions. The interaction of the Crimes Act definition of New Zealand with provisions of the other Act is unclear, in my view. Section 2 of the Crimes Act defines New Zealand as including \"all waters within the outer limits of the territorial sea of New Zealand (as defined by section 3 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977\", but section 3 of that Act defines the territorial sea as encompassing the sea within 12 nautical miles of a baseline, being the low water mark along the coast of New Zealand, including the coast of all islands.\n: The statutes don't fit together well, and the Law Society made this argument as well—that there is a good argument that the bill enacted in its current form wouldn't apply to the Ross Dependency. Now, that might entirely be the Minister's intent, but I think that, at this stage of the House's work, it's useful for us to clarify that. The Law Society suggested that, potentially, there could be an amendment here to make it clearer. Similarly, they spoke about how the law would apply to Niue. It's stated, of course, in section 3 of the Niue Constitution Act that it shall be self-governing; however, section 6 provides that \"Nothing in this Act or in the Constitution shall affect the responsibilities of Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand for the external affairs and defence of Niue.\" The question is, really, whether the Minister's view is that that would also mean that people would fall within that sense of allegiance as well.\n: The other issue that the Law Society spoke about was the statement that the common law would continue to apply rather than specify what the common law is in terms of who owes allegiance and who doesn't. They particularly pointed to the issue of renouncing citizenship or repudiating allegiance, and, in the Law Society's view, there would be some merit in actually stepping through, within the statute, who that includes and who it doesn't. In many ways, it would seem absurd if someone were to validly, and with documentation, renounce their citizenship, and potentially be living overseas as well, but, through some interpretation of the common law, be determined to still fall within one of the people who did continue to owe allegiance.\n: Another matter that I have been reflecting on since select committee, and I can't recall that this came up within the select committee itself, is the issue of New Zealanders who are working within foreign embassies and the treatment of them both overseas as well as in New Zealand. Presumably, it would apply to individuals who are staff of other embassies in New Zealand—I know that embassies often attempt to recruit from home countries, but, again, it's not unusual for administrative staff to be locally recruited. How would the bill, when enacted, apply to them, but also New Zealanders who may be employed in foreign embassies, potentially with dual citizenship as well? While that feels clear in the context of being within New Zealand, if the Minister could respond to those individuals who are working in embassies outside of New Zealand, I would be grateful.\nHon Dr DUNCAN WEBB (Labour—Christchurch Central): I'm looking forward to the Minister of Justice's elucidation of these points, once he gets some advice, obviously. But, look, one of the things that's really interesting here—because this is the Crimes Act, right? The Crimes (Countering Foreign Interference) Amendment Bill creates a crime and the trigger is that if you're going to do bad things hurting the interests of New Zealand, the flip side is that to be criminally responsible, you have to owe allegiance to the Sovereign of New Zealand.\n: Then, in the new section 2A(2), inserted by clause 4, it says, \"this section is not an exhaustive code of the law relating to the circumstances in which a person owes allegiance to the Sovereign … of New Zealand;\", so it's just opened the gate. The thing about criminal law is that you want to be pretty clear about when you're liable, when you could be charged with a crime, right? A lot of the bill kind of steps through—my previous contribution talked about, well, what about if you're a resident? What about if you're a tourist? What about if you're on a worker's visa and so on. There are going to be clear yes or no answers to that.\n: The question here is what the hell does it mean to say it's not an exhaustive code as to whether or not you owe allegiance to the Sovereign of New Zealand? Is there going to be some situation where, to take a recent instance, you are a child of a person who is tangata whenua who has a moral claim to citizenship, and you're a spy for a foreign State in a foreign country—does that mean you could conceivably owe allegiance to the Sovereign of New Zealand or basically, what else? Why do we need a vague, open-ended framework that says, \"Here are the circumstances where you do owe allegiance. Here are the circumstances where you don't, but just for a lack of clarity, that's not everything. There could be something else, but we'll let you know that when we get round to it.\" That's ultimately what phrasing like \"this section is not an exhaustive code of the law relating to the circumstances in which a person owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand;\" means.\n: So you could be a person who might, for whatever reason, hold in high esteem the interests of another State and you might be gleaning information from situations you're in and secretly passing it on to another State. All of a sudden you land in New Zealand and you say, \"Well, I'm not a citizen. I'm not a resident. I'm not even on a worker's permit.\", but the authorities say, \"Ah, but no, that's not an exhaustive code. You're not allowed to glean information in that way, because we think you owe allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand in some other way.\"\n: So it is a concern that we've got a criminal statute which kind of harks back to the Star Chamber where you kind of made things up as you went along, where you just said, \"We are of the view that it is appropriate in the circumstances kind of ex post facto to impose liability.\" So I'd be interested in the Minister's own observations, clearly, on when there might be something which is not captured by the rules in the subsequent parts of the section but nevertheless, someone could owe allegiance because, actually, this is the trigger for liability here and it's a relatively serious thing, so I'd be interested in the Minister's observations there.\nHon PAUL GOLDSMITH (Minister of Justice): I can respond to the concerns about who's in and who's out by just referring to the bill where it says, in new section 2A(3), \"A person who is in New Zealand owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand\"—anybody who's in New Zealand owes allegiance to the Sovereign—\"unless 1 or more of the following apply:\". One and two are, essentially, diplomats, and three is a person who's an enemy alien—i.e., somebody that we're at war with—and is not a New Zealand citizen and is not bound by the Oath of Allegiance, or a child of such a person.\n: Everybody who's here in the country is somebody who owes allegiance to the Sovereign if they're in the country, unless they're a diplomat or a person who is an enemy alien. It's reasonably clearly outlined in the legislation, and I think we're getting slightly distracted, trying to draw what this legislation here is, which is focused on dealing with foreign interference, which is a real threat that we face, and I don't think it's helpful to try and draw into a debate around citizen rights of children of actors in relation to this topic.\nTEANAU TUIONO (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair, and thank you to the Minister for engaging on this topic as well. I note the comments made by Vanushi Walters around Niue and the Ross Dependency, and also, as a Cook Islander, I'm interested as well, because Cook Islanders hold New Zealand passports. The Cook Islands and Niue are part of the New Zealand Realm—so, technically, in New Zealand. So it would be good for the Minister to draw out exactly what that would mean for Cook Islanders in this instance, because I know that people will be listening with interest as to whether they owe allegiance, and exactly what that means. We have seen in recent events in the Cook Islands where there has been a difference of opinion around the relationship with China, for example, and concerns both in the Islands themselves and here within the Cooks Islands community as well.\n: So the issue of who owes allegiance to whom is an important one, because it poses a lot of questions that actually need specific answers in terms of the allegiance to the Sovereign. What exactly does the Minister mean in this particular case; how does it pertain to Pacific Islanders who are part of the New Zealand Realm; and what will that do in terms of the ability of people in those countries to be able to express a different opinion, to be able to have different relationships with different foreign countries? Whether we like those relationships here in Wellington here or not, there are possibilities and ways for them to be able to engage in those relationships.\n: So I think it's an incredibly important issue around what allegiance to the Sovereign actually looks like, and I do agree with the point made by Dr Duncan Webb about this being not an exhaustive code as well, because I know that people in the Pacific Islands will be worried about whether they fall within that non-exhaustive code as well. So these are important questions and it would be good to get some answers from the Minister.\nVANUSHI WALTERS (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair. I did have another question in relation to this new section that's going to be inserted as to whether the Minister of Justice considered the concept of temporary allegiance, which is actually a concept that has deep historical roots. In Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England published in 1765, it suggested that allegiance arising from birth in England was inalienable, but that there was also something that was temporary allegiance owed to the King by aliens only while resident in England. So that was one argument; that you only owed this allegiance to the King while you were there under, as Dr Webb has suggested, maybe temporary circumstances—that could be expected of you while you were in New Zealand, for example.\n: The other argument that also has come out of Blackstone's very early arguments on this historic concept of temporary allegiance is the idea of a ligament of allegiance, in that you might owe allegiance to the Crown, but similarly, the Crown owes obligations to you. Prior to the statute of treason in 1351—when the common law purely applied—there was an argument that that was the way in which one should formulate what allegiance is; that you only have that obligation in so far as the Crown is complying with its obligations. If the Crown fails to do so, then those obligations no longer exist, or they may exist in some sort of diminished state.\n: So my first question is really whether that was brought into the Minister's thinking in terms of framing how there might be temporary allegiance obligations of those people who are temporarily in New Zealand, quite rightly? Many of them come with other citizenship obligations, which they don't derogate from when they come to New Zealand. They may still vote in those elections that are happening overseas as well, and so we should bear in mind those more nuanced ways of understanding allegiance and build them into legislation at the get-go.\n: The other question I have on this is whether there was consideration for a carve-out or an exemption from liability if there was an officially induced error? This was another proposal that was put forward by one of the submitters where there could be merit in including an officially induced error defence in the section, which would apply where a person has formally sought advice from the New Zealand Government as to whether they owe allegiance to the Crown in the right of New Zealand and they're advised that they did not. So they've sought that advice, the advice has come through saying that they're not, and, subsequently, they're charged with an offence under these new provisions. It's almost that reliance defence where one would think that, ordinarily, that person had a reasonable excuse. If they do, then that ought to be written specifically into statute.\n: I circle back to the Law Society's point about being very specific about what is and isn't included here, rather than adopting general language that the common law applies, because we are talking about a serious offence. We are talking about a taint as well after someone might be convicted of this offence. So it is very important that we get this clear.\n: Again, just wanting the Minister's consideration or thoughts, reflections on whether temporary allegiance was considered as a concept; if not, why not? Particularly for those on temporary class visas and his views about the exception: should it be in there? Does he believe that it falls within the common law scope of what would be excluded if that person relied on advice from the Government or would they otherwise be held to be accountable for breaching the provisions of this new law, even if they had that advice from the Government that they didn't owe that allegiance?\nHon PAUL GOLDSMITH (Minister of Justice): In relation to the last question about whether we considered views, I'm not sure the extent to which detailed consideration of temporary allegiance was given, but we have certainly not decided to go down that route.\n: In relation to our friend from the Greens' reference to \"people may be expressing different views\"—I think was the phrase he used; I might have got that wrong—from different parts of the Realm expressing different views: this is not a question of free speech or expressing views. It's about people who engage in covert, deceptive, coercive, or corruptive conduct for or on behalf of a foreign power to intentionally compromise a protected New Zealand interest, or as reckless as to whether that conduct is likely to compromise an interest. So we're not talking about expressing views. It's a very different thing indeed.\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. I do understand where the Minister's coming from, and I think that foreign interference is incredibly serious. Even if you're looking at something that we'll touch on later, in terms of clause 7—if you're looking at section 69 of the Crimes Act, particularly new subsection (1B), inserted by clause 7(1), it is punishable by up to 14 years of imprisonment. So we understand the severity of it, which is why this new definition that has been introduced, of the meaning of a person who owes allegiance, is particularly important because this is the crux of a lot of what is going to be coming in terms of the rest of the bill, in terms of the actual offence itself.\n: Now, I know that my colleagues have touched on persons \"in New Zealand\". I actually want to focus more on persons \"outside of New Zealand\". Understanding that, when we're looking at new section 2A(4)(a), (b), and (c), inserted by clause 4—certain areas like, for example, (c)(i) and (b) are potentially relatively easily understood. But I want to focus on subsection 4(c)(iii), which is \"has family or property in New Zealand that demonstrates an enduring connection to New Zealand.\" Now, this section is a new section: section 2A. It comes immediately after section 2 of the Crimes Act, \"Interpretation\". Therefore, any words that are coming out of 2A will be leveraged off the interpretation or definition that comes under section 2.\n: The reason I focus on this section is that under section 2 of the Crimes Act's, under \"Interpretation\", there is no definition of \"family\". So how broad is \"family\"? I understand that potentially the keyword here is \"enduring connection\" but just hold on to that thought for the time being. \"Family\" is not defined in the interpretation section; property is. \"Property\" in section 2 is defined as \"includes real and personal property, and any estate or interest in any real or personal property, money, electricity, and any debt, and any thing in action and any other right or right or interest\". So \"property\" has an incredibly broad definition in section 2. If we consider \"enduring connection\", who then determines what that enduring connection is and how broad we make it? Is \"family\" immediate? Is \"family\" a great, great, great-aunt? Is \"family\" second cousin twice removed? That \"enduring connection\" is not clear.\n: Now, I do want to combine that with what is in new section 2A(4A) and (4B), which is \"Interpretation\". It says in (4B) that where it is a question of law, \"the prosecutor or the defendant may adduce\"—may adduce. So in the event of what we're seeing in terms of defences, does the person need to then be arrested first, stand trial, and then, in this case, is it for the judge or evidence heard by the jury to determine what that enduring connection is? In those kinds of events, how many people are going to be potentially held under the definition of new section 2A(3) of a person who owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand, if they have, like I said, a great, great-aunt or a second cousin twice removed here in Aotearoa New Zealand or property? I see they may have accrued a debt or a parking fine from travels that they've done here in New Zealand; potentially one day they may want to come back. Is that considered an enduring relationship?\n: Those are my three questions. What is the definition of \"family\"—four questions, sorry. What is the definition of \"family\", definition of \"property\", definition of \"enduring connection\", and does it mean that the judge or evidence heard by a jury will need to determine that after the person has been arrested?\nHon Dr DUNCAN WEBB (Labour—Christchurch Central): Thank you, Mr Chair. Just moving on to clause 7, which inserts new section 69(1A). This is quite interesting because it's actually not strictly about foreign interference; it's about an allied series of offences, which are kind of treason and mutiny. But I have a quite specific question here, because the new subsection (1A) talks about \"A person who owes allegiance to the sovereign in right of New Zealand commits an offence if the person, outside of New Zealand, aids, incites, counsels, or procures the doing or omission outside [of] New Zealand, by any person not owing allegiance to the Sovereign … New Zealand … any act which, if done … by a person owing such allegiance, would be any of the crimes mentioned in subsection (1).\" Subsection (1) mentions, amongst other things, treason and mutiny. So, basically, you can't find someone who doesn't owe allegiance and then use them as your tool to commit the crimes of mutiny.\n: Then, new subsection (1B) says, \"A person who commits an offence against subsection (1A) is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.\" Well, there's a couple of things in there. Firstly, if you look at the Crimes Act, which we've got to remember, Minister, was drafted in 1961, and a few clauses haven't—it doesn't look like they've been reviewed since then, because \"mutiny\" includes some strange language. Mutiny is: endeavouring at any time to seduce any person serving in the New Zealand forces from his or her duty. So a strange use of language there, but, essentially, seeking to induce someone not to do their duty, to breach their duty as a member of the armed forces. But the interesting thing is this: the penalty for inciting to mutiny—that's section 77 of the Crimes Act—is 10 years. The penalty for being a party to inducing someone else to do that is 14 years. Now, usually being a party, that is to say conspiring or, you know—what's the other word? You'll know, Arena Williams. It's usually a lesser offence. So how can it be more serious to incite an offence than to commit an offence? You get 14 years for inciting an offence, but you get 10 years for doing the offence itself. It makes no sense.\n: So if you could explain to me why inciting mutiny is 14 years in prison, but being mutinous is 10 years in prison, that would be a really handy elucidation.\n: And I've got a lot more to go, because this is a very difficult piece of legislation, it's very complex. I'll come to further \"[incitement], counsels, or attempts to procure\", in new subsection 69(2A) at a later time. But if the Minister of Justice would be kind enough to respond to that, that would be very handy.\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): At the risk of leaving the House in suspense, the time has come for me to report progress.\n: Progress to be reported.\n: House resumed.",

Earthquake regulations—recently repealed, and not a day too soon—have cost Kiwis billions. Saving $8.2 billion is what will occur when we remove these earthquake standards. Too many people have suffered and had their livelihoods taken away because a Parliament and a group of politicians decided that being seen to do the right thing at a moment in time was more important than the underlying rights of New Zealanders. The warnings were there—I voted against that legislation myself—but nobody took the warnings seriously enough, and it was only nine years and billions of dollars later that we are able to start putting those valuable resources into things like car crashes and cancers that, sadly, kill so many more Kiwis.",

That principle provides that \"legislation should not take or impair property without the consent of the owner unless there is good justification and fair compensation is provided.\" The inclusion of \"impairment\" is essential to the intent of the bill, which is to focus attention on the impact of legislation on existing interests and liberties as well as good lawmaking processes. When the Government is considering passing legislation that impairs property rights, the nature and extent of that impairment should be made clear, and relief should be considered. However, the committee's change clarifies that the principle is intended to address situations where there is a high degree of impairment, not simply any impairment. Therefore, a reference to \"severe impairment\" has been added, which means the principle will not be engaged when there is not a severe level of impairment.",

We have his criteria, and he described, in his speech, that they were just rights of ordinary people and that they were, of course, not collective rights.

Of course, we already have in existence the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. We heard mention of them before, again from the contribution from Dr Duncan Webb. This committee are, and I say this with admiration, are some truly independent law nerds, and they look at the legislation—they don't look at the policy; they look at the legislation—and say whether or not it will work and how it could be improved.

The term \"core Crown\" has never come up anywhere else that I know of, so if the Minister wouldn't mind first defining what she means by \"Crown\", because school boards themselves are Crown entities—in effect, school boards are the Crown. So if the Minister is saying that we don't want school boards, as Crown entities, to be in charge of overseeing student work—and let's say schools already have a number of obligations, responsibilities, and accountabilities. We have seen that in the past, school boards have been charged with neglect. So school boards already have to do that. By giving effect to Te Tiriti, it doesn't actually mean what the Minister thinks that it means.

I would assume that the removal of Te Tiriti o Waitangi is probably quite a big one to consult with the Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti on. So I'm just checking if the Minister has consulted with the other responsible Minister in this area, on this, and whether the Minister will see this potentially open up to things like, you know, a Waitangi Tribunal application. Because, again, we do, broadly, have an obligation in Aotearoa for things like the inclusion and, in this case, the removal of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

Yes, there are some Crown entities that have Treaty obligations, but school boards are very, very different than any of those. They are predominantly made up of parents who are, essentially, volunteers, who have a range of things that they need to achieve in the governance of their school. We don't, as a Government, and this Cabinet has decided that the core Crown has the duty with iwi Māori in relation to the Treaty of Waitangi and that it is not up to a school board to try to decipher how to give effect to the Treaty. We are, instead, being very clear with school boards: what are the things that you need to do around language, cultural competence, and ensuring that there are equitable outcomes for tamariki Māori so that they are very clear and not having to try and decipher what giving effect to the Treaty is, because that is the job of the Crown; that is the decision of Cabinet.",

The way that we do that in education is to make sure that we are providing resources, that there is bilingual education like the kura kaupapa and rumaki units, and that we are actively protecting the language, and a part of that is to provide resources. It's only one way, but it is an important way of making sure that we are actively protecting that taonga of te reo Māori, which is exactly what we're doing.

What about these really fundamental questions about self-expression and identity? Because if they are to be in that list of things, I think the Hansard needs to reflect that now so it's very clear.

The reason I ask this question to the Minister is because we have seen significant investment this year in truancy, which is an important element of any school's planning and reporting, but, more importantly, as I'm travelling around the country and talking to different schools, I realise that a school's ability to plan and report is a lot more complex than simply just to say that students need to attend school.",

We're seeing in the latest report by Asian Family Services, we're seeing 46.3 percent of the parents report that their child has been bullied at school. We know that bullying is a major driver of truancy. We also hear from communities, and particularly rural communities, that the cancellation of school bus routes has been a significant factor when it comes to school attendance and issues with school attendance and students being able to attend.",

But in my amendment, I make the argument that with the kind of changes that we're seeing—and particularly with some of the changes that we're seeing in, let's say, NCEA, which isn't coming into effect until much later—a prudent way of asking schools to be able to have that ability to prepare for the first and subsequent strategic plans, which is 29B, is to delay it by a further year.

I want to check in terms of that, in conjunction with my Amendment Paper, Amendment Paper 402, which is to replace \"on the day after\" with \"six months after\". The reason I put this amendment together is mainly because of the fact that what we have seen, especially with the new amendment that has just come out this morning, it has caught school boards by surprise, is that there has been no indication that sufficient time has been given for school boards to be able to be compliant with the bill once the bill has been enacted. Unlike the section on universities, I haven't seen within this bill, anyway, and the Minister may like to speak to that, that allows school boards to be compliant with the new requirement—or at least shift towards the new requirement—once it has been enacted, if it's only the day after Royal assent. I think a six-month transition period is sensible for the schools to be able to do something like that, unless the Minister is suggesting that while the commencement date comes into force the day after Royal assent, school boards may not need to immediately be compliant or need to make the relevant changes that we see in this bill.

There is a question, I think, as to whether it is appropriate for those significant changes to come in without a select committee process, without the chance to socialise that, not only with the Teaching Council, those employed by the Teaching Council, those affected by the changes to the governance of the Teaching Council, those impacted in the wider education sector, the profession.

I wonder if that might include, to the Minister's reckoning, or at least to the Minister's consideration, some of the work that the important ethics committees and others might do in that space, with respect to the medicines.

Yet they want to be sure that, when these types of matters are raised and medicines are brought into this country, the origin of those particular medicines, of both its manufacture and of course its preparation and packaging, is clear and is well understood for those in New Zealand. At the moment, those regulations are pretty tight.

We do accept that there are efficiency gains, in that there will be a reduction of duplication of effort, consistent with our trade and health cooperation frameworks with Australia. I think where the rubber hits the road, though, is around the dependence on secondary legislation, and there are operational details, such as time lines, data requirements, verification procedures, that will only exist in future rules, not in primary legislation.

I read that and I interpret that as automatic approval, and yet, that's not what this bill does. This bill still requires a sponsor to make an application. So it is not the case that we'd have a very efficient system where just with approval in two jurisdictions, there will be a requirement for automatic approval.

I did have another question in relation to this new section that's going to be inserted as to whether the Minister of Justice considered the concept of temporary allegiance, which is actually a concept that has deep historical roots. In Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England published in 1765, it suggested that allegiance arising from birth in England was inalienable, but that there was also something that was temporary allegiance owed to the King by aliens only while resident in England. So that was one argument; that you only owed this allegiance to the King while you were there under, as Dr Webb has suggested, maybe temporary circumstances—that could be expected of you while you were in New Zealand, for example.",

Prior to the statute of treason in 1351—when the common law purely applied—there was an argument that that was the way in which one should formulate what allegiance is; that you only have that obligation in so far as the Crown is complying with its obligations. If the Crown fails to do so, then those obligations no longer exist, or they may exist in some sort of diminished state.",

Many of them come with other citizenship obligations, which they don't derogate from when they come to New Zealand. They may still vote in those elections that are happening overseas as well, and so we should bear in mind those more nuanced ways of understanding allegiance and build them into legislation at the get-go.",

So they've sought that advice, the advice has come through saying that they're not, and, subsequently, they're charged with an offence under these new provisions.

In those kinds of events, how many people are going to be potentially held under the definition of new section 2A(3) of a person who owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand, if they have, like I said, a great, great-aunt or a second cousin twice removed here in Aotearoa New Zealand or property?

Firstly, if you look at the Crimes Act, which we've got to remember, Minister, was drafted in 1961, and a few clauses haven't—it doesn't look like they've been reviewed since then, because \"mutiny\" includes some strange language. Mutiny is: endeavouring at any time to seduce any person serving in the New Zealand forces from his or her duty. So a strange use of language there, but, essentially, seeking to induce someone not to do their duty, to breach their duty as a member of the armed forces. But the interesting thing is this: the penalty for inciting to mutiny—that's section 77 of the Crimes Act—is 10 years. The penalty for being a party to inducing someone else to do that is 14 years. Now, usually being a party, that is to say conspiring or, you know—what's the other word? You'll know, Arena Williams. It's usually a lesser offence.

Thank you, Madam Speaker. When Ministers give incorrect information in answers to oral questions, there is an onus on them coming back to the House and doing what David Seymour has just done and stating that they gave incorrect information, but there is also an onus on them to provide the correct information. David Seymour has just made it clear to the House that he provided incorrect information, but he hasn't done the second part of that, which is to discharge his responsibility for correcting incorrect information; it is to provide what the correct information actually is. So he has indicated that the Fire Service were disrupted more than once by having faulty equipment in responding to calls, but he hasn't told us how many times.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Does the Minister have the answer on hand? If not, the possibility is either now or at the earliest opportunity. Hon DAVID SEYMOUR (Deputy Prime Minister): Well, I'm sorry, but the Leader of the Opposition's assertion is incorrect. You do have an obligation to address questions, which I did at the time, and to correct any incorrect information, which I have. There's no further obligation. Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): Point of order, Madam Speaker. David Seymour sought leave to correct an answer, and on that basis, the House unanimously gave him leave to do so. He didn't seek leave to withdraw information; he sought leave to correct information. He has not done that.DEPUTY SPEAKER: So the advice I have is that if the Minister knows the answer, he should give it to the House, and if he doesn't, he should give it to the House as soon as possible. Hon DAVID SEYMOUR (Deputy Prime Minister): Well, with the greatest of respect, the problem is that there may not always be an answer. Therefore, you can't always be—that's why you're required to address the question; not answer it.Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): Point of order, Madam Speaker. If the Minister does not know the answer, then how would he have corrected the answer? He must know the answer; therefore, he is obliged to tell the House what the answer is, given that the previous answer he gave was incorrect. Hon DAVID SEYMOUR (Deputy Prime Minister): I just really hope that this is not how Labour Party logic works every day, because the simple fact is that while the statement made has been advised—[Interruption] DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet—the Minister is speaking. Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: —to be incorrect, that does not mean that a correct answer is available. It may be that the answer given was simply erroneous. That's why it has being withdrawn, and with the incorrect part removed, the answer is now correct.DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Minister is saying that he doesn't have an answer available—Hon David Seymour: You guys are simple.DEPUTY SPEAKER: —so, yeah.Hon David Seymour: Simple, simple.Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): Point of order, Madam Speaker. That isn't what he's saying; he appears to be saying he's not willing to give it.DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, that's not what I heard. I heard him say—Hon David Seymour: Simple, simple man.DEPUTY SPEAKER: —there wasn't an answer available. That is what he just said to the House.Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): So, a further point of order, Madam Speaker. If it, therefore, becomes clear that David Seymour has been advised what the number is and he has chosen not to give that information to the House, will he still be in breach of the House, as he would have been had he not corrected it? Hon DAVID SEYMOUR (Deputy Prime Minister): Speaking to the point of order, maybe I can help the member out. I've been advised that a number is not currently available, so therefore it's not possible to answer the question—which is what I've been trying to get through to the simple man over there this whole time. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yeah, that's fine. There's currently—Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: A further point of order, Madam Speaker. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I'm accepting that there's not currently an answer available that the Minister has at this point in time—Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Yep, I'm accepting that, too. DEPUTY SPEAKER: That's what he said. Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition): You'll note that this is a serious matter, where a Minister has to seek leave to correct an answer in order to not breach the privileges of the House. I have raised the issue with you correctly and appropriately. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes. Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS: I haven't insulted the Minister. DEPUTY SPEAKER: No. Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS: Multiple times in his answers to that, he chose to insult me and attack me in breach of the rules of the House. What would the consequence of that be for him? DEPUTY SPEAKER: Look, I will follow up and have a look at the Hansard because I didn't pick up insult. I know there was a bit of to-ing and fro-ing coming from the Minister, but I didn't pick up the insult, and so I will look at the Hansard and I will come back to you.\n\nORAL QUESTIONSQUESTIONS TO MINISTERSQuestion No. 1—Prime Minister1. Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition) to the Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON (Prime Minister): Yes.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: If the economy has turned the corner, as he's repeatedly claimed, why have record numbers of New Zealanders been applying for KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals in the past 12 months?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, as I've explained to the member before, it's no doubt been a very challenging time for the New Zealand economy. The previous Government drove up spending, inflation, interest rates, put the economy into recession, and people lose their jobs as a consequence of that. But there are good signs. It's good to see that job ads are up 3.5 percent. It's good to see that building consents are up 12 percent just in the last quarter.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Is he aware that under his leadership, hardship withdrawals from KiwiSaver have outnumbered first-home withdrawals from KiwiSaver month after month, when previously it only happened once in 10 years?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, as I said to the member in my answer to his first question, it has been a difficult time for the New Zealand economy. We inherited a recession that was probably the worst in 35 years. There was a long COVID hangover, thanks to the previous Government being the second biggest spending Government in the Western world—spending $66 billion that no one seems to know where it went to. The reality, though, is that things are getting better: exports are up 4 percent; interest rates are down 300 basis points.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Has increasing the cost of doctors visits, home insurance, public transport, car registration, the price of going to a pharmacy, and student loans during a cost of living crisis made things better or worse for everyday kiwi families?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I acknowledge that many of those things that drive inflation, and particularly electricity but also, most importantly, council rates—that member opposes council rates. If he wanted to tackle that problem, he would come on board with the Government's initiative to put a cap on rates.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Is the Government considering a law change to ban homeless people from central business districts; if so, why?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Our Government's doing everything we can to support people who are in homeless situations, and that's why you've seen 300 more places made available through Housing First. A hundred of those 300 homes and accommodation have already been built; 200 in Auckland. But, of course, our Government, our Ministers, will work with lots of people to see what we can do.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Point of order, Madam Speaker. It was a very straight forward question: is the Government considering a law change to ban homeless people from central business districts, if so; why? I didn't ask the Prime Minister, what does he think about homelessness; I asked him specifically whether they're considering a change to the law to ban homeless people from CBDs.DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Prime Minister did say that the Government will do what they can. I would like to know if the Prime Minister could elaborate on that to answer that specific part of the question.Rt Hon Christopher Luxon: I'm quite comfortable I've answered one of those legs of those two legs in that question.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Is the Government considering a law change to ban homeless people from central business districts?Rt Hon Christopher Luxon: There have been no Cabinet decisions or discussion on that topic.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Has the Cabinet discussed a law change to ban homeless people from central business districts?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: In answer to the answer I just gave the member for his last question: no.Chlöe Swarbrick: When, if ever, will the Prime Minister finally respond to my many invitations to walk the streets of Auckland Central and meet the people, including the children, who his Government's policies have made homeless?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, no disrespect to the member, but when she was part of a Labour-Greens Government and had one of her members as the minister for homelessness we saw a billion dollars spent on emergency housing and a 37 percent increase in homelessness. This Government's record on housing I would line up against Labour, Greens, Te Pāti Māori any day of the week. The great Labour Prime Ministers of their era must be rolling in their grave with the legacy of Labour—DEPUTY SPEAKER: OK, that's enough. Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: If booting people out of emergency accommodation has fixed the homelessness problem, why is the Government now considering changing the law to ban homeless people?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I reject the characterisation of that question, because here's the deal on housing: this Government has delivered housing affordability for people who want to purchase a house or to rent a house. This is the Government that took 6,000 people off the State house wait-list while that member increased fourfold over six years. This is the Government that took 3,200 households out of emergency housing. This is the Government that is doing a lot to help homeless support. [Interruption]DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet, please. Is this a supplementary question? Minister Jones.Hon Shane Jones: To the Prime Minister: is the Prime Minister aware that a capital gains tax leads to complications, complexity, and administrative dead weight?DEPUTY SPEAKER: It's not—well, it is relevant to the lead question, so I'll let the Prime Minister answer that.Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I thank the member for raising that issue, because I'm saying taxing Kiwis and their houses and their KiwiSaver accounts is not the way forward to help people with the cost of living. It's just adding cost, adding tax. On this side of the House, we believe in low taxes, we believe in backing people who want to make something happen, not taxing everybody in sight.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Question number—quiet during questions, please.\n\nQuestion No. 2—Finance2. CAMERON BREWER (National—Upper Harbour) to the Minister of Finance: What is the Government's revenue strategy?Hon SIMON WATTS (Minister of Revenue) on behalf of the Minister of Finance: A revenue strategy is required by the Public Finance Act. The current Government strategy, part of the 2025 Fiscal Strategy Report, states that a good tax system is one that, among other things, \"finances public expenditure in a fair and efficient way\", \"encourages effort and investment\", and \"has low compliance and administrative costs\". It goes on to say, \"The Government will operate a stable, predictable revenue system\", and it adds that the Government \"is committed to public engagement in the design of tax policy\".Cameron Brewer: What does the strategy say about future revenue and expenses?Hon SIMON WATTS: On behalf of the Minister of Finance, the strategy recognises that Government spending is currently greater than revenue, meaning the operating balance is in deficit. Revenue and spending need to be brought back into balance. Crucially, the strategy states, \"Spending restraint is the Government's primary lever for achieving these goals. With prudent control of spending, the Government does not intend to seek\"—nor does it need to seek—\"major additional sources of revenue.\" I would also note that a tax increase, announced alongside spending increases that it matches dollar for dollar, does absolutely nothing to improve the operating deficit or Government debt.Cameron Brewer: What has the Government done to encourage effort and investment through the tax system?Hon SIMON WATTS: On behalf of the Minister of Finance, in last year's Budget the Government increased personal income tax thresholds. These had not been adjusted in the previous 14 years, despite significant wage growth. We also increased the in-work tax credit, which helps low- and middle-income working families with children, and expanded eligibility for the independent earner tax credit. Working people in this country now get to keep more of the money that they work so hard to earn. That is reward for effort, and it is delivered within tight Budget operating allowances. An estimated 727,000 households benefit by at least $75 a fortnight, and members opposite voted against it.Cameron Brewer: What—[Interruption]DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet during questions, please.Cameron Brewer: What else has the Government done to encourage effort and investment through the tax system?Hon SIMON WATTS: On behalf of the Minister of Finance, study after study has identified that, compared to other countries, New Zealand has a low level of capital investment per worker. To raise productivity, lift incomes, and drive long-term economic growth, New Zealand needs businesses, big and small, to invest in machinery, tools, equipment, technology, vehicles, industrial buildings, and other capital assets. In this year's Budget, the Government launched Investment Boost, a tax incentive for New Zealand businesses to make these sorts of capital investment. As a consequence of this policy, we expect to see a lift in New Zealand's capital stock, a lift in GDP, and a lift in wages, again delivered within tight Budget operating allowances, and again opposed by members on that side of the House.DEPUTY SPEAKER: That answer was quite long enough. I'd like them to be a bit briefer, please.Cameron Brewer: What sort of tax would be ruled out by the Government's revenue strategy?Hon SIMON WATTS: Well, on behalf of the Minister of Finance, it would be one that, according to an Australian expert report—and I quote—\"is a tax which in any administrative form must be complex and difficult and produce some abnormalities and inequalities of its own. There is no doubt whatsoever that any revenue it raises could be more cheaply and easily raised in other ways.\" In addition, if that tax discouraged effort and investment, such as an investment in small-business premises, and if it gave preferential treatment to certain groups—for example, people that inherit—DEPUTY SPEAKER: Right, I think that's a long enough answer. Thank you.Rt Hon Winston Peters: Madam Speaker?DEPUTY SPEAKER: Sorry, is this a supplementary or a point of order?Rt Hon Winston Peters: It's a supplementary, because this is supplementary time. Can I ask the Minister: looking around the world, is there any comparative equality in terms of the policy advocated by the Labour Party when it comes to the question of capital gains tax? Is there any example, anywhere in the world—Hon Willie Jackson: What a dumb question.Rt Hon Winston Peters: No, it's only dumb if you don't understand tax.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet during questions, please.Rt Hon Winston Peters: This is not mirror time for Willie; this is time when you pay attention.Hon Willie Jackson: Oh, get to the question.Rt Hon Winston Peters: With the greatest respect, this guy could take some education about taxation.Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order. With respect, the question should have been ruled out by now. The minute the Minister asked his colleague for opinions on a Labour Party policy, that was out of order.DEPUTY SPEAKER: The reason the question hasn't been ruled out by now is that there is a lot of noise coming during supplementary questions. I'd like the Rt Hon Winston Peters to ask that question again, without referring to the Opposition, and ask the question straight to the Minister, and the Opposition will be quiet.Rt Hon Winston Peters: Having heard of a recent example of a limited capital gains tax, is there anywhere in the world where an economy has adopted that policy?Hon SIMON WATTS: On behalf of the Minister of Finance, what I am clear about—and I'm not aware of other countries in the world that are looking to punish their citizens for success through taxation—DEPUTY SPEAKER: No—[Interruption] That's not an answer. Sit down, please.Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order. Madam Speaker, you made it extremely clear to the member asking the question that it was not to be in reference to any other party's policy. The Minister then, in response, completely ignored your clear guidance.DEPUTY SPEAKER: I cut the Minister off and asked him to sit down, because I could see what was happening there—Hon Kieran McAnulty: He didn't, though, did he?DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, he did. I said, \"That's enough—finish off the answer,\" and I asked him to sit down.Rt Hon Winston Peters: With respect to tax policy, has the Minister heard the statement \"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen\"?DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, that's not a question, thank you. We're going to move on to question No. 3.\n\nQuestion No. 3—Prime Minister3. CHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green) to the Prime Minister: E tautoko ana ia i ngā kōrero me ngā mahi katoa a tōna Kāwanatanga?[Does he stand by all of his Government's statements and actions?]Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON (Prime Minister): Yes.Chlöe Swarbrick: What is the effective tax rate paid by the wealthiest 1 percent of New Zealanders, and why is it half the effective tax rate of the average hard-working New Zealander?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: We have a progressive income tax system in New Zealand, and the more money you earn, the more tax you pay.Chlöe Swarbrick: How is it fair that hard-working New Zealanders pay tax on every dollar they earn through income while the super wealthy passively accumulate more and more untaxed wealth without lifting a finger?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, in answer to the member's first leg to that question: it's somewhat ironic, because she and her party did not support basic tax relief for low- and middle-income working New Zealanders. It wasn't ideological; it was a pretty simple up and down vote: do you lift the tax thresholds for low- and middle-income working New Zealanders? Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori all said no, because you do not care about working New Zealanders—period.Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order, Madam Speaker. Speakers' rulings are quite clear that no Minister should bring parties that aren't involved in the question into the fray, and that Minister—the Prime Minister—does it repeatedly and has been told by other presiding officers not to do it.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yep, thank you. I'd ask the Prime Minister to refrain from doing it for the rest of the day.Chlöe Swarbrick: Why does he think that, in the past three years, the average net worth of the wealthiest 20 percent in this country grew by 20 percent while the poorest 20 percent got poorer by 9 percent if not economic rules that are geared towards the benefit of the wealthiest?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: You asked me why—because there was something called a Labour-Greens Government—DEPUTY SPEAKER: No—[Interruption] I'd ask the member to ask that question again. That was a swing at the Opposition, and it wasn't an answer to the question.Hon David Seymour: Point of order! Madam Speaker, the member asked a question about a period of time during which, as the Prime Minister says, there was a Labour-Greens Government. I don't see how that's not a legitimate response to the question.DEPUTY SPEAKER: I'm asking the member to ask the question again, please.Chlöe Swarbrick: Why does the Prime Minister think that, in the past three years, the average net wealth of the wealthiest 20 percent grew by 20 percent while the poorest 20 percent in this country got 9 percent poorer if not because of an economic system that is geared to benefit the wealthy?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, because when a Government increases spending by 84 percent, and it drives up inflation to 7.3 percent, that then leads to higher interest rates—they went up 12 times—high interest rates puts an economy into recession, and people lose their jobs. The consequence of all of that is that working and middle-income New Zealanders got incredibly hurt and damaged.Chlöe Swarbrick: So when does he expect his tax cuts and Public Service cuts to trickle down?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, the good news is that the economy is growing now in this quarter. We have job ads up. We have building consents up. We have exports up. We have interest rates down. We have inflation down. We have business confidence up eight points. We have farmer confidence at a good level. We've got Accor building hotels now—their 49th, going on to their 50th. We've got Port of Auckland and Freightways talking about good activity. Loan arrears are down. They're all positive signs.Chlöe Swarbrick: What is more important to the Prime Minister: allowing the wealthiest to amass hundreds of millions in untaxed wealth or properly funding our hospitals, our schools, our emergency services, and our infrastructure?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I'm actually very proud that this is a Government that realised about $40 billion of inefficiency, deployed it to the front line, including almost $17 billion in healthcare in our first Budget and a further increase of 6 to 7 percent in our second Budget.Hon Shane Jones: On the matter of Government actions, can the Prime Minister confirm that, by exempting a substantial number of companies from the onerous obligation of reporting mythical climate emissions, our economy will be better off for it?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Anything that lowers compliance and regulation and red tape and green tape is a good thing for New Zealand because we've got to get the show unblocked and get it moving. Again, I'd just say to the Opposition party, support our fast-track legislation and mining.Chlöe Swarbrick: Does the Prime Minister agree with the assertion from his Minister, just then, that climate emissions are \"mythical\"?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: He didn't make that assertion. He said climate reporting, that is adding huge amounts of cost and compliance to businesses, is a waste of time. Chlöe Swarbrick: Point of order, Madam Speaker. We have demonstrable evidence, almost immediately, that the Minister said precisely that. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, I do believe that the Minister did use the word \"mythical\" in his question—about climate reporting, though, wasn't it? It was about climate reporting, right?Chlöe Swarbrick: Madam Speaker, if I recall correctly, it was about reporting on \"mythical climate emissions\".DEPUTY SPEAKER: Ok. So—Hon Shane Jones: Speaking to the point of order! The mythology refers to the beliefs of the party across the road. They are the ones who introduced that policy. It is mythical because it's disappeared. Chlöe Swarbrick: Speaking to the point of order!DEPUTY SPEAKER: Sorry, is this a point of order or a question?Chlöe Swarbrick: I'm speaking to the point of order, in which I asked the Prime Minister a very straightforward question, whether he agreed with the assertion from one of his Ministers about whether climate changing emissions were mythical or not.DEPUTY SPEAKER: And the Minister just clarified that the policy was now mythical because the policy was no longer in place. So, we've—Chlöe Swarbrick: Madam Speaker!DEPUTY SPEAKER: —so we've clarified that. No, is this a new question?Chlöe Swarbrick: I guess I just have a question for the House about whether the truth matters anymore.DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, this—[Interruption] OK. Order, please! Yes, the truth does matter, and we're going to move on to question— [Interruption] Quiet, please!Rt Hon Winston Peters: Point of order. Madam Speaker, the last question is utterly offensive to this House. It's not within Standing Order or Speakers' rulings, or any other procedure of the past—Ricardo Menéndez March: You would know!Rt Hon Winston Peters:  Of course, I'd know! Far more than you, sunshine! And that's why I'm raising this point of order. That member should be required to stand now and apologise to the House.DEPUTY SPEAKER: No. No, we're moving on.\n\nQuestion No. 4—FinanceDEPUTY SPEAKER: I had to tell the Opposition to be quiet during questions before, and now I'm going to tell the Government members to be quiet during questions.4. Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana) to the Minister of Finance: Does she stand by her statement of July 2024 that \"cost of living relief is on its way\"; if so, why?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Finance) on behalf of the Minister of Finance: Yes. The reason why is that the statement was made two days before personal income tax changes came into effect on 31 July 2024. The member might be aware that the next sentence goes on to say, \"From Wednesday, [you'll] be able to keep more of your hard-earned money to put towards things that are important to you, your children, your weekly shop, [and] paying your power bill.\" Those changes, mostly to income tax thresholds and the in-work tax credit, made around 1.9 million New Zealand households better off, on average, by $60 a fortnight. Households with children were better off, on average, by $78 a fortnight. And it is strange that the member would ask about that particular quote, in this particular week, because there is now a clear choice between a Government that wants to spend carefully, reduce your tax burden, and let you succeed on your own terms, and an Opposition that wants to put their hands in your pocket with a creepy and creeping capital gains tax.Hon Barbara Edmonds: How many families, therefore, lost money because of the tax changes which came into effect on the date the Minister just reported?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, the tax threshold increase meant that people were liable to pay less tax. So if there was any group that somehow paid more, then I guess you would point to them. But 1.9 million households were better off.Hon Barbara Edmonds: How many families have received the full $250 tax cut that was promised by this Government?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: The fact is that that promise is a sliding scale: it is a range of relief that might be received. And the Opposition can spend as much time as they like pointing out that rather obvious fact, but the people back at home want to see a Government that spends their money as carefully as the people in it would spend their own, and is able to reduce taxes rather than putting new taxes in front of them that will take all sorts of things that they might not have expected, because they can't trust \"Chippy\".Hon Barbara Edmonds: If the cost of living relief is on its way, why are KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals the highest they have been, more than double what it was this time two years ago?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, the voters, I believe, have a lot more intelligence than they're sometimes given credit for by the Opposition. They can see that the conditions New Zealanders face in the economy today are caused by a combination of factors overseas, historic policies by the New Zealand Government, and the initiatives of the current Government. And when they look at the current Government, they see a Government that is carefully managing its spending, that is presiding over falling inflation and falling interest rates so that New Zealanders have more money in their pocket left at the end of the week. The voters can work it out; if only those people could.Hon Barbara Edmonds: Are families getting more, when 5,530 people made KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals in the month of September?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: It is clear that there are people having a tough time, and we feel for people that are in the position—Hon Ginny Andersen: Do you? Really?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: —of drawing on their KiwiSaver. I'd just say to Ginny Andersen, who says, \"Do you? Really?\", actually, yes.Hon Ginny Andersen: I don't think you do.Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: When a person answers a question in the House—oh, Madam Speaker, point of order. She's just said, \"I don't think you do.\" Now, to say that a member is deliberately misleading the House—DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think that—Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: —is a breach of order, and she—DEPUTY SPEAKER: That was an interjection going both ways, so carry on with the answer.Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, no, I'm sorry, Madam Speaker, it is a breach of the Standing Orders to accuse another member of lying. She did it twice and repeatedly—DEPUTY SPEAKER: No. No—Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: —and she should be asked to withdraw and apologise.DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, the member didn't accuse the Minister of lying; she just said she thought he didn't understand.Hon Barbara Edmonds: Who else is there to blame for her economic mismanagement, given her Government has blamed Labour, power companies, Fonterra, insurance companies, supermarkets, US tariffs, \"merchants of misery\", teenagers, John Key, teachers, firefighters, doctors, nurses, local councils, and unions?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, there was a man once who was called Christian Cullen, and he was known for being fast on his feet. Barbara Edmonds is the opposite of Christian Cullen. She stomps through question time with her lead shoes, reading out the questions that had been written down before, not changing tack when anything else changes in question time. As I said in a previous answer, the voters have a lot more intelligence and perspective than they are given credit for by the Opposition. They can appreciate that a combination of historic Government policy, of events that have occurred overseas, and the current Government's actions influence the conditions they face. And the current Government's actions are to spend money carefully, to take pressure off inflation, to see interest rates coming down, to cut red tape, and to improve the prospects of New Zealanders. They can see that this Government is fixing what matters for them; these guys are out of touchHon Paul Goldsmith: Does she stand by her statement that the Labour capital gains tax plan is a \"terrible idea\"?DEPUTY SPEAKER: That's not related to the original question, thank you. Question No. 5—[Interruption] Quiet, please. Quiet!\n\nQuestion No. 5—Biosecurity5.  CAMERON LUXTON (ACT) to the Minister for Biosecurity: What recent announcements has he made about strengthening the biosecurity system?Hon ANDREW HOGGARD (Minister for Biosecurity): Last week, I announced the Government's plan for overhauling the Biosecurity Act, to safeguard New Zealand's primary sector into the future. As an island, food-producing nation, our prosperity relies on protection from biosecurity threats. New Zealand exports $60 billion of food and fibre products each year, and our relative freedom from pests and diseases is a big part of our competitive advantage and underpins our primary sector. That's why we're modernising the Biosecurity Act with nearly 50 proposals for change that will strengthen protection against invasive pests and diseases. Cameron Luxton: How could an invasive species or a disease that impacts animals have such a big impact on our economy? Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Oh, he's really kicking the hornets' nest now.Hon ANDREW HOGGARD: Yes, we'll take care of them. The primary sector really is the backbone of our economy, but we cannot afford to be complacent. Diseases and invasive species can spread fast and wipe out entire sectors if they are not prevented at the border or detected early and managed properly. Economic analysis from the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) says a foot-and-mouth incursion would cost over $14 billion a year. That wouldn't just cost farmers; it would shut down our economy and permanently damage our international reputation and credibility. Our biosecurity system is strong, and we're committed to maintaining a strong border and robust biosecurity systems.Cameron Luxton: How will the biosecurity system at the border be strengthened?Hon ANDREW HOGGARD: One of the things we will be doing is to introduce a new offence for not declaring high-risk goods, such as raw meat, at the border. This offence will attract a fine of $800, while low-risk goods not declared will stay at $400. Our relative freedom from pests and diseases is greatly valued by all Kiwis, and this will remind visitors that New Zealand takes biosecurity seriously. We cannot afford to put our primary sector and our natural environment at risk, and the best way to manage any biosecurity incursion is to stop it from happening in the first place.Cameron Luxton: What changes have been made to import health standards?Hon ANDREW HOGGARD: We're improving New Zealand's import rules by making the development of import health standards more flexible and allowing risk assessments to be tailored to the scenario—for example, we will enable the ability to issue a one-off permit for goods where it wouldn't make sense to develop and maintain an import health standard. These changes are in addition to a new programme of work I announced this year, aimed at significantly reducing the time it takes to develop an import health standard. This will enable higher volumes of trade and, thus, give exporters greater access to new materials to develop innovative products without lowering our biosecurity standards.Hon Shane Jones: On the matter of pests, can the Minister confirm: what is the status of the invasive Portuguese millipede—otherwise known as Ommatoiulus moreleti—and whether or not it has crept across to the other side of the House?DEPUTY SPEAKER: Does the Minister wish to answer the first part of this question? I have no understanding of what that species is.Hon ANDREW HOGGARD: I believe in terms of where you've got a pest at a regional level, the regional council does take precedence. But yes, we will be looking to equip biosecurity with lots of flamethrowers, to try and remove that and spiders.\n\nQuestion No. 6—Health6. SAM UFFINDELL (National—Tauranga) to the Minister of Health: What actions is the Government taking to increase vaccination rates?Hon SIMEON BROWN (Minister of Health): Our Government is taking the current measles outbreak very seriously. Cases are now confirmed across multiple regions, and the risk of continued transmission is high. That's why, this week, Health New Zealand launched a nationwide Measles Immunisation Week, to highlight the need for Kiwis to get immunised. Measles is a serious disease. In the 2019 outbreak, one in three people who contracted measles needed hospital care. That's why Health New Zealand is running pop-up clinics, tracing contacts, and supporting families to lift our vaccination coverage—to stamp out the measles outbreak and to prevent the wider impacts of this disease on our schools, our health system, society, and the economy.Sam Uffindell: What steps has the Government taken to reduce the impact of serious diseases, like measles?Hon SIMEON BROWN: We have reinstated the health target for immunisation. After years of decline, our latest quarterly health target results show that 82 percent of children were now fully immunised by age two, up from 76.5 percent at 30 June last year, representing the largest annual gain across all of our health targets. This shows that our focus on targets is working. Whilst this is a significant increase, though, there is still much more work to be done. Health New Zealand is working with providers to make it easier for people to get their MMR vaccines and other vaccines, including through extra and pop-up clinics, to prevent the outbreak from worsening.Sam Uffindell: Why is it important to increase the MMR vaccination rate?Hon SIMEON BROWN: Measles is one of the most infectious viruses in the world. One case can infect 12 to 18 unvaccinated people. If you're not immunised and you're exposed, there's a 90 percent chance that you will catch it. Vaccination is the single best way to protect families, prevent community spread, and take pressure off our hospitals, with two doses of the MMR vaccine providing about 99 percent protection. We need around 95 percent coverage to stop future outbreaks and to stamp out the current incursion. Over the last few years, rates fell; we are now turning that around, but there's still more work to do.Sam Uffindell: Why did the Government reintroduce the immunisation target?Hon SIMEON BROWN: Let's be clear: we're committed to giving every child the healthiest possible start to life. Targets matter because, ultimately, that helps to drive the system to ensure that we can reach the targets needed to prevent outbreaks such as what we are experiencing today. It also ensures that children get the protection they need when they need it. Whilst New Zealand's overall vaccination rates have improved, there is still much more work to do. That's why Health New Zealand is working with providers this week and all weeks—particularly this week with the Measles Immunisation Week—to drive up immunisation rates and to promote the need for immunisation so that we can act decisively to prevent this outbreak from spreading.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Is it correct that despite his Government's performance against the target, the number of susceptible people is estimated to increase by a thousand a month and, therefore, the risk of an outbreak continues to grow irrespective of the target?Hon SIMEON BROWN: I would say to that member that it is critically important that we focus on improving immunisation rates. I would point out what happened to immunisation rates under the previous six years, under the Labour Government, where they fell from around 92 percent of two-year-olds to around 75 percent of two-year-olds, due to the removal of the target. We have reintroduced the target. We are now focused on meeting it. We acknowledge that there's a lot more work to do, and we're focused on doing it.Hon David Seymour: What approach is the Government taking to school attendance in the course of this outbreak, particularly during NCEA exams, and what advice has the director-general issued to schools, in relation to attendance and the outbreak?Hon SIMEON BROWN: The Director-General of Health has provided very clear advice that school students should continue to attend schools and exams, unless they are identified as a close contact and aren't immunised. It's about making sure that we continue to get our children the education that they need. Ultimately, though, the very clear message is that whether it's teachers or students, immunisation is the best protection against measles, and we're encouraging everyone to take up that opportunity to get immunised. The latest data which I have just received shows that there was around 2,500 measles immunisations delivered yesterday—the highest number since 2019.\n\nQuestion No. 7—Prime Minister7. CHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green) to the Prime Minister: E tautoko ana ia i ngā kōrero me ngā mahi katoa a tōna Kāwanatanga?[Does he stand by all of his Government's statements and actions?]Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON (Prime Minister): Yes.Chlöe Swarbrick: Does the Prime Minister stand by his answer to the Greens in question time, December 2023, when he said, and I quote, \"We're not weakening our actions on climate change, we're just going about it in a different way.\", when his Government has just announced weakening our methane targets by halving them?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I think we've been very clear about our position on methane targets. We have the best farmers in the world. We have the most carbon-efficient farmers in the world. The madness of the previous administration of sending production offshore to less carbon- and production-efficient countries makes global greenhouse gas emissions worse. We want to maintain our delivery of our commitments that we have. [Interruption]DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet during questions, please.Chlöe Swarbrick: Does the Prime Minister understand that Government policy which increases climate-changing emissions will ultimately increase New Zealanders' cost of living?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: We're not going to drive our farmers offshore and shut down farming production in New Zealand. We are not here to punish our farmers. They are the best in the world. They are the most carbon efficient in the world and we back them to succeed out there in the real world.Chlöe Swarbrick: Is the Prime Minister aware that for every Government action that increases emissions, we become more liable to pay billions of dollars offshore for other countries to reduce their emissions?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, I'm not punishing New Zealand farmers in any stretch of the imagination. These are the farmers that get up early each and every day. This is the farming sector that's pulling New Zealand out of the recession that the Labour-Greens Government created. We are backing our farmers. We are not punishing our farmers. They do an outstanding job and we've got the right policy to help them.Chlöe Swarbrick: Point of order. The question was specifically about our constructive liabilities under the Paris Agreement, which the Prime Minister should understand, and the fact that if we are not reducing our climate-changing emissions domestically, then we have liability to pay other countries to do that. He did not even address the question.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Does the Prime Minister want to expand, please, on the liability part of that question?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: This is a Government that is doing everything it can to meet its climate obligations, including Net Zero 2050, and, based off our latest emissions reduction plan, there's a possibility we may even do it earlier.Rt Hon Winston Peters: Prime Minister, when you were answering that question, were you giving the answer to the Māori version or the English translation version, given that the latter is not an accurate translation of the former?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, can I just be unambiguous in either te reo or English that we are backing farmers, our policy is the right one, we're going to make sure that we deliver on our commitments, but importantly, we are powering up this economy and we are all about economic growth.DEPUTY SPEAKER: I actually think that that wasn't an actual question. The translation is not the Prime Minister's responsibility; it's part of the question.Hon Shane Jones: Supplementary question?DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is this a supplementary to question No. 7?Hon Shane Jones: Yes. A question to the Prime Minister: is he aware that one of the most wealthiest men in New Zealand has abandoned the hyperbole and hysteria of climate change, in the form of Bill Gates?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: What I'm aware of is that if you want to back climate change, you would support fast-track legislation, you'd support mining for critical earth minerals, you would support ending the oil and gas ban because, actually, that's what's needed in this country.Rt Hon Winston Peters: Point of order. Madam Speaker, the translation may be not the Prime Minister's role or responsibility, but I asked the question as to what he was answering, the Māori version or the English version, and you thought that you'd dismiss it by saying, \"Well, we all know that's not his responsibility.\" So let's have this question: why aren't you fulfilling your responsibility, and your staff, and getting it right in the first place?DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, I'm not accepting that point of order. This is a translated question which has been on notice for today and it's on the translation on various other days. The Prime Minister is well aware of what the question means and I'm moving on to question No. 8.\n\nQuestion No. 8—Health8. Hon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour) to the Minister of Health: Does he stand by his statement that \"We want all New Zealanders to be able to see a GP when they need one\"; if so, is it acceptable that almost one in six New Zealanders cannot afford to go to the doctor?Hon SIMEON BROWN (Minister of Health): In the context it was made, yes. Our Government is committed to ensuring that all New Zealanders can access the care they need when they need it. To do this, we have delivered the biggest ever funding boost for GPs—$175 million this year alone—and allowed a fee increase of just 3 percent, keeping costs stable and predictable. We know that the biggest barrier for patients today is actually getting an appointment. In 2023-24, 25.7 percent of adults couldn't see a GP due to wait times, up from 11.6 percent in 2021-22. That is why we are focused on affordability and accessibility. We're extending prescriptions to 12 months where safe, saving patients up to $105 a year in GP fees; strengthening the primary care workforce; launching a 24/7 online GP care service for times when patients can't see their regular GP; and we continue to target support through subsidised GP visits for community services card holders, and the Very Low Cost Access scheme. All of this is about putting patients first and making sure that every Kiwi can get in to see a doctor when they need to.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Will he help the tradie who said to me, \"I don't go to the doctor's, because I can't afford to; I earn $24 an hour.\"; or is he not bothered by the fact that cost is preventing working people from seeing the doctor?Hon SIMEON BROWN: Well, as the member will be aware, there is the community services card scheme, which means that those people earning that amount of money are able to pay a maximum of $20 co-payment. Ultimately, that member's policy is to put a capital gains tax on property, on commercial buildings, and on KiwiSaver so that people earning high incomes can go to the doctor for free.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Does he recognise that the cost of doctors visits is harming patients, like the woman who wrote to me that she self-treated her joint problem with anti-inflammatories because she couldn't afford a $60 visit and ended up with hearing loss?Hon SIMEON BROWN: What I'd say to that member is that the increased number of New Zealanders who could not access a GP appointment because they couldn't get one went from 11 percent, under her watch, to 25 percent. The other point that she fails to actually mention is that the cost of GP fees went up by 30 percent under Labour. We're focused on increasing accessibility and affordability, such as our policy of extending prescriptions, saving people with long-term conditions $105. I have not heard from the Labour Party whether they actually support that policy.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Is it fair that, under his Government, a woman with pneumonia has to chose between her own health and that of her diabetic husband because they can't both afford to go to the doctor?Hon SIMEON BROWN: As I said earlier, the cost of seeing a GP went up 30 percent under the Labour Party's watch. We're focused on improving accessibility and focused on improving affordability with policies such as extending prescriptions to 12 months. I am yet to hear from the Labour Party as to whether or not they support our policy of extending prescriptions up to 12 months. That would save people up to $105 per year in seeing a GP. I have not heard from the Labour Party whether or not they support that policy.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Is the 70-year-old grandmother with asthma, diabetes, and high blood pressure, who has cancelled her last three doctors appointments because she can't afford it because of the $75 fee, getting the care she needs?Hon SIMEON BROWN: Patients with asthma, such as that grandmother, and such as me, require long-term prescriptions, and our policy will mean they won't have to get repeat prescriptions, costing $105 per year, and they will be able to get a 12-month prescription. I am yet to hear whether or not the Labour Party supports that policy.\n\nQuestion No. 9—Tourism and Hospitality9. SUZE REDMAYNE (National—Rangitīkei) to the Minister for Tourism and Hospitality: What recent announcements has she made to support tourism in New Zealand?Hon LOUISE UPSTON (Minister for Tourism and Hospitality): Recently, I've made two joint announcements that will bring more visitors to New Zealand and boost our economy. Over the weekend, Minister Potaka and I announced $10.8 million of funding to complete two sections on the Mountains to Sea great ride. These sections are among the last needed to complete the full trail from Mount Ruapehu to the Tasman Sea. Minister Stanford and I also announced that, as of yesterday, Chinese visitors are now able to travel visa-free from Australia to New Zealand. Tourism is a key part of our Government's plan to grow the economy, and these announcements will help do just that.Carl Bates: How will the cycle trail announcement support the regions?Hon LOUISE UPSTON: We know the benefits a thriving tourism and hospitality sector brings to our economy, supporting local regions and communities. Ready-to-go projects like the cycle trails will bring more visitors to the Ruapehu region and entice them to stay longer and boost the central North Island economy. Overseas tourists coming to New Zealand remain a key driver of regional growth, and we want them to experience our great rides. Our Government is fully committed to supporting the regions to thrive, including getting more visitors to every corner of New Zealand.Suze Redmayne: Why are Chinese visitors important to New Zealand's tourism market?Hon LOUISE UPSTON: China is New Zealand's largest trading partner and our third largest source of international visitors. In the last year alone, we welcomed almost 250,000 Chinese visitors to our land. We also know that over 60 million Chinese travellers are actively considering a visit to New Zealand, and China will play a pivotal role in doubling New Zealand's exports over the next 10 years. We're committed to welcoming more Chinese visitors to New Zealand and strengthening the ties between our two countries.Suze Redmayne: How will more international visitors support economic growth?Hon LOUISE UPSTON: By investing in tourism, we are creating opportunities for growth, as tourism supports one in 10 jobs in New Zealand and contributes $44 billion to our economy. Every time a tourist comes to New Zealand and spends money in a local shop, buys food in a local restaurant or cafe, and stays in our accommodation, it's good for jobs, it's great for growth, and it's great for the incomes of New Zealanders. Our message is clear: New Zealand is open for business, and we welcome visitors anytime, anywhere, from any place.\n\nQuestion No. 10—Social Development and Employment10. Hon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour) to the Minister for Social Development and Employment: Does she agree with the Prime Minister's statement regarding employment, \"They do have jobs. Often what happens is the people will take a job, they don't stick with it for longer than a couple of days, they don't show up on time\"; if not, why not?Hon LOUISE UPSTON (Minister for Social Development and Employment): Yes, I do agree with the Prime Minister's comments that he made about young people. We know young people may need more support and training to be job ready. We have already made the welfare system more active and brought back rights and responsibilities with the traffic light system to help people stay on track. We are encouraging New Zealanders to be ready for work while also backing employers who need committed staff to grow their businesses and our economy.Hon Ginny Andersen: Would the people of Tokoroa have more jobs right now if they had followed the Prime Minister's advice and stuck with a job longer than a couple of days and showed up on time?Hon LOUISE UPSTON: On behalf of the people of Tokoroa, I find that member's comments offensive. I know the local MP has spent time with them on Friday, supporting the community with job opportunities, with recruitment agencies, with on-the-ground support from the Ministry of Social Development and community organisations, and I find that member's comments offensive.Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order!DEPUTY SPEAKER: I've got a point of order from Kieran McAnulty, and we may be thinking the same thing, but make your point of order.Hon Kieran McAnulty: Madam Speaker, if a member finds a comment offensive, then the person who made it should be made to withdraw or apologise. In this instance, the person who made those comments is the Prime Minister; he should be made to withdraw and apologise.DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, I think—Hon Louise Upston: Speaking to the point of order!DEPUTY SPEAKER: Speaking to the point of order, I think the member was referring to the comments of—Hon Louise Upston: I was, and speaking to the point of order, that member is speaking about a quote that has nothing to do with Tokoroa, and he might want to check his facts before raising it.DEPUTY SPEAKER: I'm going to say that I did not find the member's statement, or question, offensive to the people of Tokoroa. I took it more that there have been some job losses over there, and the member may wish to clarify that, because it didn't sound offensive to me.Hon Ginny Andersen: Speaking to the point of order, the comment was made about young people. There are young people in Tokoroa who no longer have employment, and I wanted to know whether that related to them or not.DEPUTY SPEAKER: OK, thank you. You can ask the next question.Hon Ginny Andersen: Does she agree with the local people of Tokoroa who said that cutting their trade training capabilities right after so many job losses is just another kick in the guts; if not, why?Hon LOUISE UPSTON: I would really encourage the member to get her facts straight. In terms of the Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology, the Minister responsible for vocational education has ensured that there is additional funding available for Toi Ohomai, both for the Tokoroa campus and for the Taupō campus, to ensure that training is available on the ground.Hon Ginny Andersen: Why then did her Government force Toi Ohomai to cut jobs in trade training right after record job losses in the very same region?Hon LOUISE UPSTON: I think the member is confusing a number of things, and as I said, she might want to get her facts straight about Toi Ohomai in the centre of the North Island and the campuses in Tokoroa and Taupō. The member of Parliament for Taupō has worked incredibly closely with the council and with businesses on the ground to ensure that there is training available. What I don't think is particularly helpful, in this House, is to bring in the lives of a challenged group of locals who have lost their jobs recently. I feel for them and their families, and I don't believe it is suitable for that member to be dragging them into this House with issues that are actually factually incorrect.DEPUTY SPEAKER: I believe the member's asking questions on their behalf, rather than targeting her questions at them.Hon Ginny Andersen: Does she agree with the Prime Minister's statement that employers in the Hawke's Bay are \"crying out\" for young people; if so, why are there 7,359 job seekers but only 568 advertised jobs in the Hawke's Bay?Hon LOUISE UPSTON: I would like to just encourage that member to realise that we are seeing some really positive signs. If you look at the increase recently in the online job advertisements, it shows that there are increased opportunities in construction and hospitality, of which there are jobs in the Hawke's Bay. I would encourage members to look at where there are positive opportunities, instead of doubling down on those who have challenges.Hon Todd McClay: Has the Minister seen media reports over the hard work of the member of Parliament for Taupō in working to ensure that Toi Ohomai's campuses in Taupō and also in Tokoroa remain open and that they were facing significant changes that would have led to a lack of training locally in those communities, as a result of the significant wasteful spending of the last Government and a wasteful reorganisation?Hon LOUISE UPSTON: Yes, I have seen reports of the work that the local member of Parliament has been doing on the ground with stakeholders, with the council, with Toi Ohomai, with the unions, with the community organisations, with other training providers, and with other polytechs—DEPUTY SPEAKER: And that's a long enough answer.Rawiri Waititi: Point of order, Madam Speaker. Was she answering that question with the Pākehā translation of \"Taupo\" or with the Māori translation of Taupō?DEPUTY SPEAKER: She was saying it in her form of pronunciation.Hon Ginny Andersen: How can she agree with the Prime Minister and say that there are jobs available, when 600 people applied for one casual job at mini-putt golf in this region?Hon LOUISE UPSTON: As I said, there is positive annual growth, and it's up 10 percent for the construction industry, 10.2 percent for the IT industry, 6.8 percent for the hospitality industry, and 2.9 percent for the primary industries. We should be positive. We should be looking forward, as well as the 240,000 jobs that are coming over the next couple of years because of this Government's investment in infrastructure and this Government's work to unleash businesses by getting rid of red and green tape.\n\nQuestion No. 11—Trade and Investment11. PAULO GARCIA (National—New Lynn) to the Minister for Trade and Investment: What has the Government recently announced about strengthening trade and economic ties with Singapore and Chile?Hon TODD McCLAY (Minister for Trade and Investment): Just last Friday, at APEC in Korea, along with the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Singapore, and the President of Chile, we launched negotiations for the Green Economy Partnership Agreement, or GEPA. This will be a high-quality agreement that boosts trade and investment between our countries and will drive economic growth in New Zealand. This agreement will position New Zealand businesses at the forefront of the growing global green economy, which is expected to be valued at $19 trillion by 2040.Paulo Garcia: What are the key pillars of the Green Economy Partnership Agreement?Hon TODD McCLAY: The GEPA, as it's called, will cover many innovative areas, including sustainable finance and investment, green goods and services, sustainable agricultural food systems, and low-emissions fuel alternatives. It aims to bring down barriers, lower costs, and reduce tariff rates across the green economy, and, once completed, it will be open to other countries to join. Our shared vision for the GEPA is to support new trade opportunities and efficiencies for businesses, reinforce the rules-based order of international trade, and lower trade barriers while achieving climate change action.Paulo Garcia: How does trade and investment support sustainable growth?Hon TODD McCLAY: Well, the Government believes that solutions to environmental challenges, including climate change, will come from greater trade and cooperation with other countries, not less, and through investment in new technologies, not putting up costs on businesses or putting them out of business. The GEPA will drive investment in innovation and trade with Singapore and Chile and, in turn, will mean more exports and more investment for higher-paying jobs for New Zealanders.Paulo Garcia: What other agreements has the Government announced with Singapore and Chile?Hon TODD McCLAY: Well, successive Governments have worked away with these two countries. New Zealand, Singapore, and Chile have a proud history of shared leadership in developing innovative trade agreements to drive innovation and economic growth—from the P4 agreement, which went on to be the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, to, then, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, and, more recently, the New Zealand - Singapore Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which was agreed with Singapore and had been worked on for some time. All of these agreements have benefited New Zealand exporters, and this is why the Government is committed to doubling the value of exports over 10 years through agreements like the GEPA.\n\nQuestion No, 12—Prime Minister12. RAWIRI WAITITI (Co-Leader—Te Pāti Māori) to the Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON (Prime Minister): Yes.Rawiri Waititi: Why has his Government chosen to punish success by defunding Māori health infrastructure that saved lives and performed better than many State services during the pandemic in regard to vaccination?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Because this Government is determined to lift health outcomes for Māori, and the way to do that is to focus on lifting immunisation rates for under-twos. I would just love that member to come out and have a policy idea on doing exactly that.Rawiri Waititi: If those vaccination rates are to increase, why have Māori vaccination rates plummeted, and what is his Government going to do about it?CAMERON LUXTON: Well, this Government, in the very first few weeks, partnered with Māori health organisations, I think, from memory, to the tune of about $50  million. It has achieved really outstanding and excellent results, not just with Māori kids getting immunised but non-Māori kids as well.Rawiri Waititi: Does the Prime Minister believe that teaching our children about Te Tiriti is the foundation of a bicultural nation?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: Well, we are. But what we believe is the number one priority is, actually, academic achievement and teaching our kids the basics brilliantly, whether they're Māori or non-Māori. This is a Government that has done more in two years, with an outstanding Minister, than the previous Ministers did in the previous six. Rawiri Waititi: Is he going to ban visits not just to marae but churches, museums, and mosques also—when does this Government's intrusion on where our children can learn and visit end?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: I'm confused by the question, as to the relevance of the question, but what is unambiguous is this is a Government that is focused on lifting Māori academic achievement. It would be fantastic if that member and his party had any ideas and any policy contribution to that. We have done more to lift Māori educational outcomes than the previous six years. Let me give you an example: Māori new entrants are operating at or above expectations on the phonics checks 20 weeks into schooling life—it's up 18 percent. Māori kids actually needing targeted extra support is down 15 percent, because we are teaching the basics brilliantly and we make no apologies for doing so. Hon Shane Jones: On the matter of statements and actions, is the Prime Minister aware that the term \"wehewehe kāinga\" means splits and divisions lead both to doom and a political tomb?DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Prime Minister doesn't have any responsibility for that question.Hon David Seymour: Is the Prime Minister proud of the Government's—[Interruption]DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet, we're having a question.Hon David Seymour: —charter school kura hourua policy, which has seen schools such as Te Rito in the Far North, TIPINE in South Auckland, and soon Te Aratika in Hawke's Bay open to empower Māori to learn on their terms, their way?Rt Hon CHRISTOPHER LUXON: I am, and there are 17 charter schools now in motion and it's important. Iwi leaders I've spoken are very supportive of charter schools—even Willie Jackson's a fan.\n\nREGULATORY STANDARDS BILLDischarge—Leave DeclinedCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): Point of order, Mr Speaker. I seek leave for the order of the day for the second reading of the Regulatory Standards Bill to be discharged.ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): Leave is sought for that purpose. Is there any objection?Hon Members: Yes.ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): Leave denied.\n\nREGULATORY STANDARDS BILLSecond ReadingHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Minister for Regulation): I present a legislative statement on the Regulatory Standards Bill.ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): That legislative statement is published under the authority of the House and can be found on the Parliament website.Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: I move, That the Regulatory Standards Bill be now read a second time.This bill is a crucial piece of legislation for improving the long-term quality of regulation in our country and, ultimately, allowing New Zealanders to live longer, happier, healthier, and wealthier lives. In a nutshell, if red tape and regulation are holding New Zealanders back because politicians find it politically rewarding to tie them in red tape, then we need to make regulating less rewarding for politicians by putting more sunlight on their activities. That is how the Regulatory Standards Bill will help New Zealand get its mojo back.This bill turns the explanation from politicians passing laws that restrict our freedoms from \"Because we said so\" into \"Because here is the justification, according to a set of principles.\" To the rest of my colleagues across the House: if you want to tax someone, if you want to take or impair their property, if you want to restrict their livelihood, well, you can still do it, but you'll face tough questions about the impact that those actions have on people's property rights, their freedom, and the compliance of your proposal with the rule of law. It does this by introducing principles of responsible regulation into primary legislation, with a focus on good lawmaking processes and the effect of lawmaking on existing interests and liberties.When making legislation, agencies and lawmakers will have to consider the principles and be transparent about those considerations. Agencies will need to confirm that the legislation and the process for developing it has been reviewed for consistency with the principles and summarise any inconsistencies with those principles. That work will need to be published, and, where an inconsistency is identified, the responsible Minister or the maker of any secondary legislation will need to explain the reasons why.Let's put that into perspective by considering some issues that matter to Kiwis and how the Regulatory Standards Bill helps us avoid such mistakes. Earthquake regulations—recently repealed, and not a day too soon—have cost Kiwis billions. Saving $8.2 billion is what will occur when we remove these earthquake standards. Too many people have suffered and had their livelihoods taken away because a Parliament and a group of politicians decided that being seen to do the right thing at a moment in time was more important than the underlying rights of New Zealanders. The warnings were there—I voted against that legislation myself—but nobody took the warnings seriously enough, and it was only nine years and billions of dollars later that we are able to start putting those valuable resources into things like car crashes and cancers that, sadly, kill so many more Kiwis.I want to touch on one change that's been made to one of the principles of good regulation that has been particularly topical: the takings principle. That principle provides that \"legislation should not take or impair property without the consent of the owner unless there is good justification and fair compensation is provided.\" The inclusion of \"impairment\" is essential to the intent of the bill, which is to focus attention on the impact of legislation on existing interests and liberties as well as good lawmaking processes. When the Government is considering passing legislation that impairs property rights, the nature and extent of that impairment should be made clear, and relief should be considered. However, the committee's change clarifies that the principle is intended to address situations where there is a high degree of impairment, not simply any impairment. Therefore, a reference to \"severe impairment\" has been added, which means the principle will not be engaged when there is not a severe level of impairment.The bill does not require any action to be taken or compensation to be paid; the responsible Minister can provide a statement of reasons why they consider a severe impairment to be justified, and, if not paying compensation, the reasons for that position. However, the point is that this principle will make it easier for Parliament and the public to see where property rights are being severely impaired, with the intent of helping to reduce instances where impaired property rights without compensation lead to New Zealanders being so much poorer. I look forward to the committee of the whole House stage, when we can talk about the specifics of this bill in further detail. Overall, I'm proud to be responsible for a piece of legislation that is going to bring discipline and transparency to New Zealand's lawmaking processes.This bill, when enforced, is going to support the people of New Zealand by ensuring them that serious consideration is being given to legislation that impacts on their lives and livelihoods. If we're asking New Zealanders to comply with regulations in everyday life, then it's only reasonable to ensure that they're clear, consistent, and meet a certain standard. When they do not meet that standard, the public rightfully expects lawmakers to be transparent about that fact. The passing of the Regulatory Standards Bill in later stages will take us a step closer to a more principled, transparent, and accountable process for making legislation in New Zealand. It will help build confidence in the legislative process, support better outcomes for New Zealanders, and ensure that our regulatory system is fit for purpose in the 21st century.I've been very interested to see how easily people have mischaracterised this bill in the debate that has ensued, and I would like to touch on two changes, or two objections, that I think are misguided. One has been the repeated assertion that, somehow, the Regulatory Standards Bill imposes restrictions on Parliament and, therefore, is undemocratic. The law is crystal clear; it's there in black and white. The purpose of this law is to promote accountability and transparency to the Parliament by the executive. This enables our democracy—it enables greater transparency.Building on that misconception has been another widely shared in the public domain that, somehow, the principles are inadequate because they don't include all of the objectives that the Government might have. A Government might wish to uphold the Treaty of Waitangi; it might wish to pursue goals around equity or public health or environmental protection. The fact that those are not included as principles reflects the fact that every initiative brought to this House and every regulation made by a Government is already assumed to have a public purpose. It is already assumed to have a purpose like one of the ones that I listed. The purpose of this bill is to enable and make transparent the Government of the day, to be able to show the public, and for the public to be able to see, where that collective purpose and the pursuit of it is impairing the rights of ordinary people. It's not a surprise that it doesn't include collective goals; the purpose of the law is to show when ordinary people's rights are being impaired.I'd like to thank the Finance and Expenditure Committee for its very efficient consideration of the bill. I would like to also acknowledge the changes that they have made to the Regulatory Standards Board—in my view, strengthening the bill by enhancing its independence and by saying that it will be reinforced by the Governor-General rather than the Minister for Regulation. I believe that that is going to make the Regulatory Standards Board a much more august body with more authority, and it will allow that board to further raise the quality of the consistency accountability statements. Without further ado, I thank everybody for listening, and I commend this bill to the House.ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): The question is that the motion be agreed to.\n\nHon Dr DUNCAN WEBB (Labour—Christchurch Central): Kia orana e te Mana Whakawā. Well, here we have it: a bill that 0.7 percent of submitters supported. Here, it is hard to find a bill which fewer people are in favour of, but this National Government is the lapdog of the ACT Party in this instance, sitting there and doing the ACT Party's bidding. The real irony of that speech by David Seymour is that this bill is one of the worst in terms of regulatory quality that I have ever seen. Do you know who said that? The Ministry for Regulation and the Ministry of Justice in the regulatory impact statement (RIS). They said this bill has been poorly consulted on; it hasn't got a problem that it needs to address—even if there was one, it's the wrong solution; and the Minister won't let us do our job and explore other options. That is how you make bad law, and that is what we've got here.One thing that struck me about the submissions process was the long list of submitters who came in and gave really thoughtful submissions. Not people from particular perspectives, but NGOs, even Government organisations, came in and said this is a bad idea. You know who looks after our legislative quality at the moment? The Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Excellent body:  thoughtful people; hate politics. They said, \"[these] principles are novel and deeply contestable\"—in other words, this is not a straightforward bill. This is a politically charged, ideological bill.What did the New Zealand Law Society say? \"It is striking that the process and content of a Bill purporting to promote good law-making and high-quality legislation should fail to meet not only the Bill's own standards, but the existing established processes for supporting good law-making.\" So it's a bad bill.The New Zealand Human Rights Commission, our independent human rights body: \"The Bill embeds a narrow set of principles that prioritise individual and private interests as paramount considerations in lawmaking, effectively sidelining wider considerations of collective wellbeing\". The Human Rights Commission hates this bill.Then you've got a whole lot of regional councils. The Greater Wellington Regional Council: this bill \"Will impact on local government, creating legal risks, inefficiency, complexity and increased costs\". Does that sound like good law to you? I picked those quotes because they are not politically aligned. They haven't got an axe to grind. They are thoughtful people who explained why this bill is bad law. Of course, David Seymour says \"Here's my list of regulatory principles—but don't worry, you can have other things in there. You know, just because I haven't mentioned Te Tiriti o Waitangi doesn't mean it's not in there.\" That is rubbish, because what this bill does is it highlights what, in his view, are the most important principles. At the top of that hierarchy are private property rights.This bill is seeking to entrench, by the back door, private property rights as a constitutional principle. In fact, the chief economist of his own Ministry for Regulation wrote a paper saying that private property rights are the most important human right not currently in our law—so we can see where it's coming from. These principles are totally selective. Private property is not a guiding light for good legislation and regulation.The fact of the matter is that equal treatment—the second principle, stating that everyone should be treated equally—is shorthand for the status quo. It's shorthand for saying, \"Take the existing inequalities in our society and don't seek to address them.\" It's saying, \"Where wealth has accumulated, leave it there.\"Well, on this side of the House, we believe in equity. We believe in addressing the inequities which are troubling our society. Of course, not only is it silent on the Treaty; it's silent on all kinds of other key principles. All of our international obligations—nowhere in that bill does it say we should adhere to the promises we as a nation have made in the international community, whether they be around human rights or whether they be around defence and trade. Human rights. What does it say about gender? What does it say about disability? What does it say about race? It says absolutely nothing.Cameron Luxton: We're not debating human rights.Hon Dr DUNCAN WEBB: No—the ACT Party doesn't want to debate human rights. The ACT Party is not interested in human rights. The ACT Party is interested in property rights.This bill is constitutionally significant. It is about how law is made. Now, the fact of the matter is that for a constitutional bill, the process has been shocking. A constitutional bill should be careful, thoughtful, and, ideally, engaging on a cross-party basis. This has been anything but. This bill is seeking to entrench property rights into our lawmaking process by stealth, and at speed. It basically promotes private property interests over collective benefits.Fundamentally, this is about looking after corporate interests—because if we think about all of those rules there, all of those impairment rules, if we try to protect our communities, if we try to reduce the use of vapes or if we try to limit alcohol advertising, all of these are impairments. Now, David Seymour would say, \"Well, you can do it; you just have to say why,\" but we know that putting sand in the gears of legislation makes things least likely to happen, and that's what he wants to do. He wants to tilt the playing field in favour of corporate interests. Look, even the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment came along—not known as a great supporter of the left, but he came along—and he had a lot to say. The most important thing he had to say is this: this bill puts the environment at risk, because nowhere does the environment feature. So when your bureaucrats are doing their bureaucratic job, and all of this new blue tape and yellow tape that David Seymour's creating—as they're running through their checklist, where does it say, \"How does this impact climate change?\" \"How does this impact biodiversity?\" \"How does this impact sustainability?\" It doesn't say it anywhere, because at the heart of this bill is putting property and private interests over community environment and sustainability.The bill, also, is just a failure. It's an absolute procedural and regulatory failure. As I've said, failed its own RIS. The very thing it says we should do, which is check a bill for good process; it was examined, and they said it didn't meet good process. Probably the most important thing, if we have an issue with regulatory quality in New Zealand, the question is: what's the best way to fix it? The short answer by everyone who was asked the question is: not this. We have a whole lot of rules out there already, a whole lot of bodies—the Attorney-General, the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, the Regulations Review Committee, every select committee, and the list goes on, of quality checks that exist for legislation which aren't engaged in sufficiently already, largely because as Government ignores them and rides roughshod over them. This year, we had a situation where the scope of the question was limited. David Seymour, against all his own advice, came into this with a closed mind, poor problem definition, and a solution that was in place before the problem was identified.But here's the other thing. This bill will cost a fortune. Not only will he have to set up its Regulatory Standards Board as a little pet board at a cost of probably $2 or $3 million but every Ministry will have to follow his new yellow tape—all of his rules he's put in place. How much will that cost? Well, MBIE said that department alone will have to spend 15 percent of its time following David Seymour's little rules at a cost of $60 million—$60 million. You can rubbish it, David Seymour, but you've seen the report, and you know it. It's a total waste of money.The second thing, or the final thing, is this: this bill puts into the hands of the Regulatory Standards Board the job of questioning what we do here. That's their job, second-guessing Parliament—and for a party that talks about parliamentary sovereignty, then that lies ill in your mouth. The bill is a waste of money, it doesn't meet its own standards, it's narrow, it's contested, and it's a constitutional change by itself. We will oppose this bill to the end.\n\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): E te Māngai, tēnā koe. Tēnā koutou e te Whare. I guess at the end of the day, the real question for this House is precisely who asked for this piece of legislation. It wasn't health experts, it wasn't the legal profession, and it definitely wasn't former Prime Ministers and those who have led former political parties. It wasn't regular New Zealanders. In fact, regular New Zealanders decided to overwhelmingly oppose this piece of legislation.So if we just boil it down to the two main threads of arguments that were heard at the Finance and Expenditure Committee and have been well canvassed in the media landscape over the last few months as this Minister for Regulation has decided to push this legislation through despite the overwhelming opposition, on the one side, we've heard that it's largely redundant, that it is going to be duplicative, and, as indeed, Dr Duncan Webb alluded to, it'll be expensive. Then on the other side of the debate, at the most egregious end, we hear very clearly that what this legislation does is provide a framework for multinational corporations to be compensated by the people of this country when this Parliament decides to curtail their supposed right to destroy our shared environment, our climate, or to curb our human rights.So I think again, one of those foundational questions we hear a heck of a lot from the libertarian or the supposed libertarian party in this place is about special treatment for certain demographics in our country. We have to ask ourselves: who, really, is getting special treatment in this country? So frequently we hear the Minister in charge of this legislation say that it is precisely the same communities and demographics who are disproportionately overrepresented in every single negative statistic in our society. We don't hear next to anything about the corporations who are exploiting both people and planet. In fact, they seek to pass this legislation which makes it easier for them to do precisely that exploitation.I find it quite fascinating that we are indeed having this debate about how a law is made, this law being the constraints of the rules of how we are supposed to progress with making legislation into the future, and we have a situation where the Minister couldn't follow his own rules. He wants to talk about good lawmaking, yet he couldn't even uphold the processes of good lawmaking.Today, the Minister of Education is removing Te Tiriti obligations from schools and saying that it is the Crown's obligation to uphold those obligations, yet we have represented in this very piece of legislation the removal and the de-prioritisation of Te Tiriti as a principle that is to be considered in good lawmaking practices.Which leads us to the statement from the Waitangi Tribunal, and here I quote from their urgent inquiry report none the less, that the Crown accepted that its policy development for the bill occurred without targeted engagement for Māori. The tribunal found that this was in violation of the Crown's obligation to consult with Māori in good faith and therefore violated Treaty principles of partnership and active protection.Further, we hear from the likes of the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee who submitted on the first round of the design of this legislation, which I might add had approximately 25,000 submissions, which again were overwhelmingly opposed to this legislation. They said, at that point in time, that they had, \"misgivings about the capacity of this bill to offer improvements\" because they see risks with the proposals, including the risk of significant unintended consequences.They then went into three key prongs: the bill is unnecessary to the extent that it restates existing constraints in the principles of good lawmaking. Secondly, the principles contained in the bill are selective and deeply contestable. Thirdly, the bill has the potential for significant constitutional impact that has not been fully explored.If we are to take the Minister's arguments in good faith at just that surface level and to ignore all of the behaviour and everything else that he has said about our many communities across this country, if we are to believe that the aim here is to make good law, then surely there should have been a good lawmaking process to produce this very law which would have brought the people of this country along for that process.Instead, what we have ended up with is something whereby, as the Minister would say, it's the people who are wrong. It's his own officials who are wrong. It's the legal experts who are wrong, the environmental experts, the health experts, former Prime Ministers, and the overwhelming majority of regular New Zealanders who used their time to oppose this legislation—99 percent of them—only to be ignored yet again by this Government.Then we have the impartial Law Society who says, and I quote, \"As well as being the product of inadequate consultation, the content of the Bill itself runs contrary to established precepts of legislative design in various important respects. It is striking that the process and the content of the Bill purporting to promote good law-making and high-quality legislation should fail to meet not only the Bill's own standards, but the existing established processes for supporting good law-making.\"Then we hear about the red tape—the red tape. Well, let's just talk for a minute about the yellow tape which the Minister's own ministry advised him he would be creating with this very piece of legislation. Firstly, the creation of the Regulatory Standards Board, which we've just heard will cost in excess of approximately $3 million of taxpayers' dollars per year. Then there are the new compliance costs with the requirements for each ministry and agency and department to create a consistency accountability statement. Then thirdly, at the conservative estimate of $60 million per year, the requirements to review existing legislation.Again, I'd make the core point that if the Government genuinely wanted to engage on the point of how we make good law and improve our constitutional arrangements in this country, we're game. We'd be totally down for that, because, in fact, I think that it would be great if we could have some form of agreement about the values and the principles that guide this country. But what we instead unfortunately have represented here is a pet vanity project from one guy in one political party that has sought to pass this legislation three times and failed until it met such a poor negotiator as our current Prime Minister.So on those foundational values, well, I hold the very earnest and perhaps some on the Government side might say naive view that New Zealanders actually care about each other and the planet that we live on. But those principles, well they're nowhere to be seen as far as the design of this legislation. Again, we would make the point that if the Government wanted to actually meaningfully engage on how we could go about creating these better processes, the Greens absolutely would have been the first ones sitting around the table. Unfortunately, what we have here is the entrenchment of special rights for those who currently own things.As we well canvassed in question time today, this Government cares not a whisker for addressing inequality—inequality which is compounding under intentional Government decisions that have been made to push more children into poverty, to make more people homeless, to increase our climate changing emissions, and in turn the cost of living for New Zealanders, whilst also making it more difficult for our farmers to farm. Guess what! They're the ones hit first and worst by climate change. If we wanted legislation that actually addressed these issues, we could be debating that here in the Chamber today, but instead, we unfortunately have this petty, petty vanity project. I'd just make the other point that you kind of can't have it both ways. On one side of things, the Government is saying, \"Don't worry. Nothing to see here. This is kind of just business as usual. This aligns with stuff that's kind of already happening and in train.\" But then on the other side we've got a Minister professing that this is a bit of a foundational shift in our constitutional arrangement. Again, I think I tend to believe the latter, because what we've seen from our Prime Minister is an inability to grasp the detail of the things that he has negotiated and put our country on the line for in order to cobble together this coalition Government.I just make, in my final 30 seconds, an appeal to the New Zealand First Party. Will the New Zealand First Party please stand up? Here is an opportunity to truly put New Zealand first. One of our Amendment Papers which will be tabled at the committee of the whole House stage will be to stop non-citizens from taking complaints and seeking compensation from the Regulatory Standards Board and we look forward to New Zealand First supporting New Zealand first. We oppose this bill.\n\nCAMERON BREWER (National—Upper Harbour): The Regulatory Standards Bill gives effect to National's coalition agreement with ACT. As chair of the relatively collegial Finance and Expenditure Committee, we also undertook extensive consultation on these matters. We heard approximately 30 hours of oral evidence and received over 159,000 written submissions. Of course, this follows last year's departmental consultation which attracted 23,000 submissions. FEC—the Finance and Expenditure Committee—canvassed a range of views and took a relatively liberal and cross-party approach as to who we would hear from and its acceptance of submissions. Following many submitters' feedback, key amendments to this bill have seen a best-practice tightening of the board and chair's independence and separation from the Minister and Government of the day, consistent with the provisions within the Crown Entities Act. I want to congratulate the ACT Party on what has been over 20 years of advocacy and hard work. Thank you.\n\nHon CASEY COSTELLO (Minister of Customs): I rise on behalf of New Zealand First to speak on the Regulatory Standards Bill, second reading. New Zealand First supports this bill because it promotes open and accountable government that legislates with key principles in mind: the rule of law, efficiency and regulation, property rights, an independent judiciary, and a belief that every New Zealander is created equal before the law.The bill upholds equality before the law, it promotes openness and accountability in Government, and it ensures that property holders cannot be dispossessed of their property without fair compensation, and cost-benefit analysis of legislation ensures that economic policies that will impede productivity and growth are adequately scrutinised. For these reasons, New Zealand First commends the bill to the House.ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): The next call is a split call.\n\nRAWIRI WAITITI (Co-Leader—Te Pāti Māori): E te iwi, the Treaty principles bill tried to change the meaning and the intent of Te Tiriti o Waitangi; the Regulatory Standards Bill (RSB) erases Te Tiriti entirely from Aotearoa's democracy without even mentioning it. This bill creates a world of minimal-to-no rules in order to ensure the profitability of all things; \"all things\" means at the expense of our people, our oranga, our labour, our whenua, our moana. The bill circumvents the rights you already have, by treating those rights as rules which the Government can consider inefficient and unprofitable. E kī, e kī. [Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]Te Tiriti o Waitangi is the first and the last line of defence against corporate exploitation in Aotearoa. This bill and the sham select committee process to ram it through the House is proof that true democracy doesn't exist in this country. This is what the Treaty principles bill, the takutai moana amendment Act, and the removal of Treaty clauses from legislation are really about: dismantling our collective rights to allow the Atlas Network - backed foreign companies to plunder lands, water, and resources. It creates an anti - Waitangi Tribunal, giving David Seymour's unelected mates the power to review every single law that addresses systemic inequality.Make no mistake, e hika mā, the Treaty principles bill was a distraction. Chris Luxon's donors only allowed him to vote against it because they knew this bill was coming next. The Regulatory Standards Bill is a direct assault on the constitutional foundations that protect all New Zealanders from exploitation.For te iwi Māori, this looks like \"Your rights are now rules.\" that the Government can deregulate as they see fit, especially when these rights are held collectively—for example, as a part of the common public good, or as hapū and iwi. These rights create costs that the Government, under the Regulatory Standards Bill, can deem to be unnecessary. Our people know this and this is why 98.7 percent of New Zealanders oppose the Regulatory Standards Bill, and yet not a single recommendation provided by the people was adopted. Te Pāti Māori stand with the majority of the 156,000-plus people who made submissions against the bill because they knew what this bill means for Aotearoa.For our remote and rural communities, this bill means the emergency services and authorities can make decisions about who and where to help in a crisis, based on efficiency rather than need—because it's more expensive to help everybody—and this looks like our more marginalised rural communities are being left behind.For our community kai gatherers and whānau who rely on the moana as a kāpata, the bill would enable the Government to smash our fisheries even further. For example, a rule about putting cameras on boats to monitor fisheries and illegal dumping can be argued as being inefficient because it is an unnecessary cost, with no regard for our moana or our people, who depend on it.What this means for our kaumātua is that this bill would enable Governments to raise the age of eligibility for our nannies and koros to access their super, or to significantly alter the scheme completely.For our learning support kaimahi and their tauira, this bill would allow the Government to justify reducing Māori curriculum content that would require expertise and new staff to deliver it—an additional cost that they would be able to label as inefficient purely due to the expense rather than need. The cost of education should not cost our mokopuna the ability to be supported in our education system.For our whānau rangatahi on social welfare, right now, the Government is moving debt off its own balance sheet and placing the debt as an obligation on our parents, even though rangatahi are entitled to these provisions as citizens of the state.These decisions were made without the RSB even being in place, and yet under the RSB, the situation could become the enforced norm.For our country dealing with the cost of living crisis, without rules the supermarkets will not bring the prices of food down by themselves. Their first priority is making money for their owners—which fits the purpose of the RSB—not ensuring that people have access to kai.I want to mihi to the 156,879 people who made powerful submissions in the resistance to this racist bill, the multitudes of people who donate their time, their expertise, and their aroha to fighting for the kaupapa only to be ignored. This Government won't listen to you, but Te Pāti Māori have heard you. We will get rid of this Government in 2026, and the Regulatory Standards Bill along with it. Kia ora tātou.\n\nFRANCISCO HERNANDEZ (Green): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise in anger to denounce the Regulatory Standards Bill. I would describe this bill as a wet fart of a dying Government that's run out of ideas, that's incompetent of doing what everyday New Zealanders want.At a time when our economy is at a record low and our unemployment is at a record high, at a time when a measles outbreak is rising out of control, and property damage from a climate-exacerbated natural disaster is still being repaired all around the country, you would think that this Government would be focused on that and the real issues. But, no, they've put this at the top of the Order Paper. Why? Because, fundamentally, they're a distracted, out-of-touch, ideological Government that's focused more on their imported culture wars and their pet projects than serving the needs of ordinary New Zealanders.There's been a number of super-heated, inflated claims about this bill from the other side. The first claim that's been made by the proponents of it—and, by the way, we've seen speeches from the opposite benches. We've had Mr Seymour not even give the full speech—eight minutes—we've had a one-minute speech from Mr Brewer over there, and we've had a one-minute speech from Ms Costello over here, because, fundamentally, they know that this bill is actually indefensible. They know that this bill can't be defended, because it's got no real substance to it.They say that it's about better regulation, but better regulation for who? It's certainly not for the people, if you listen to the submissions of all the number of people who have submitted against it—98.7 percent opposed—it's certainly not for the planet, if you listen to the submissions of experts, like the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment and groups that care about the environment, like 350 Aotearoa, Forest & Bird, and Greenpeace; and it's certainly not for Te Tiriti, if you listen to the expert submission by the Waitangi Tribunal on why this bill is so bad.We've heard claims that this bill will cut red tape and actually introduce a new era of prosperity where there'll be fun for all and a new level of economic activity. But if you actually listen to what the Government's own advisers have to say about this, they've said the opposite. They've said that creating a regulatory environment which is subject to chop and change, like this bill will do—because we will chop and change this bill up next term—is actually the opposite of how you create a stable environment for good investment in economic growth. This bill will cost a minimum of $60 million, and actually a lot more if you consider all the costs that's being spent on the Ministry for Regulation. So rather than cutting red tape, this bill actually creates the opposite of it. It creates a tsunami of yellow tape that will strangle the Public Service and that will create distractions from core work. So much for a Government that claims to care about economic efficiency, when the bill will do the opposite with their consistency assessment standards.Finally, this bill makes claims about good lawmaking. As we've heard from my colleagues Chlöe Swarbrick and the Hon Dr Duncan Webb, this bill has actually followed the opposite of the process of good lawmaking. From the abuse of urgency that this Government has undertaken in various legislation such as the pay equity bill, to cutting off the number of oral submissions, this bill actually gives the opposite of how you would do good lawmaking in this country.We've heard this bill denounced as an ACT Party bill, but the reality is that while David Seymour might have created the legislation—and the legislation is the gun—the reality is that Winston Peters and Christopher Luxon loaded the bullets with their complicity in allowing this legislation to pass.Now, what would the Green Party do instead? Well, we actually care about genuinely good legislation, and so the first step would be to repeal the Regulatory Standards Bill and to end the tsunami of yellow tape that this bill will create. The second is that we will abolish the Ministry for Regulation and end the libertarian industrial bureaucracy complex that this Government has entrenched in their current lawmaking. We will end the shoddiness of poor decision-making and the number of abuses of urgency that this bill has created.I want to spend the next 15 seconds thanking the submitters who have helped to create amendments to this bill, and all of the people who have taken part in this process. This Government has not and will not listen to you, but we have and together we will make this a one-term Government.\n\nPAULO GARCIA (National—New Lynn): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The object of the Regulatory Standards Bill is to increase transparency in regulation and the resulting accountability with the New Zealand public. I commend this bill to the House.\n\nHon RACHEL BROOKING (Labour—Dunedin): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for this opportunity to speak on the Regulatory Standards Bill. It is, somewhat, déjà vu for me because, whilst I haven't been involved in the select committee process on this bill, last term, we had a member's bill in the name of David Seymour, and it was very similar to this. I was able to speak on that bill when, of course, we voted it down. That is what we will do when we have the opportunity. This bill will be repealed. This bill is vain. This bill is ideological in a very negative way. I say that despite what the introduction on the select committee report back says. I will read that to you. The first sentence is: \"This bill seeks to support the executive's accountability to Parliament\". I have to say, that sounds like a wonderful and glorious ambition.As somebody who is part of Parliament but not part of the executive—the executive being the Ministers; there's not many of them in the House at the moment—most of us are members of Parliament; we are not members of the executive. We hear, over and over again, that Parliament, this Parliament of all of us, the executive members and the non-executive members, is sovereign. We can make the laws, but what actually happens is that an executive can have so much power that they make sure that all of their members, all of their non-executive members that are part of Parliament, just go along with them and don't do any scrutiny. That is a real problem if Parliament changes as drastically as it has this term.This term of Government has seen an egregious use of all-stages urgency and giant amendments coming in at the committee stage with no recourse for the non-executive Opposition members to scrutinise that, to ask experts about what the changes might mean. I hear often from the other side, \"In the last term of Parliament, there was lots of urgency used.\" There's a big difference between all-stages urgency and using urgency for different parts of a bill because you require more House time. Those two things are very different. There is also a huge difference when a bill is passed under urgency because there is something like an emergency—that is a good use of urgency—and when there are pieces of legislation passed that have post-enactment review provisions so Parliament can accept that it does need to do this thing quickly because, say, we had some space legislation earlier this year where there might be a national security interest. That is a good reason to pass something under urgency. But then, you have a post-enactment review placed so that the parliamentarians have an opportunity to scrutinise that legislation; this Government does none of those things.It is quite ironic that we have this bill here and that the introduction from the select committee starts with the sentence that this is about changing the dynamic, moving away from executive powers to parliamentarian powers. That is not what this bill is doing at all. What this bill is doing, and we heard from the Minister say something about mojo—which we hear a lot from that Government, that's all they seem to like to talk about—and then he said pieces of legislation need to be justified against some criteria. That sounds reasonable, but, of course, the criteria are David Seymour's criteria. They are not Rachel Brooking's criteria, and they are not many other people's criteria. I am amazed that both National and New Zealand First seem to have been so bamboozled by this that they have laid down and agreed to David Seymour's libertarian criteria to be used in an expensive process that will cost us all time and money and not result in better lawmaking and not, importantly, result in more power of the Parliament over the executive. We have his criteria, and he described, in his speech, that they were just rights of ordinary people and that they were, of course, not collective rights. And so, as I said before, these are not the Rachel Brooking rights. If they were Rachel Brooking rights, they would include ones about our Treaty arrangements—of course, one of our most important constitutional documents—but, no, they're not there. They would, of course, include something about the environment and, maybe, the principle of polluter pays—that's something that should appeal to libertarians—but, no, that's not in this bill either.We've heard from Dr Duncan Webb that this was a solution looking for a problem and that there have been many submissions about this question. If you do want to actually do what this first sentence says—to support the executive's accountability to Parliament—what might you do? In 2019, before I was in Parliament, the Legislation Act 2019 was passed. This Act has a Part 4, yet this Part 4 is still not in force. I just want to quickly read the purpose of Part 4 of that piece of legislation, \"Disclosure requirements for Government-initiated legislation\". Section 101 states: \"The Purpose of this Part—is to (a) better inform parliamentary and public scrutiny of Government-initiated legislation; and (b) promote good administrative practices for the development of such legislation.\" That sounds to me like a very fine ambition, one that appears to mirror what has been said about this version of the Regulatory Standards Bill. Yet I have not seen the Minister or any proponent of this bill explain why it is that they don't just bring into force Part 4 of the Legislation Act 2019. Of course, we already have in existence the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. We heard mention of them before, again from the contribution from Dr Duncan Webb. This committee are, and I say this with admiration, are some truly independent law nerds, and they look at the legislation—they don't look at the policy; they look at the legislation—and say whether or not it will work and how it could be improved. So, they already exist. Again, why are they not mentioned?I want to conclude by being very clear that the executive's accountability to Parliament should be strengthened, and there are some ways to do that. One of the ways is to bring in Part 4 of that Legislation Act 2019 that I just read out. One of the ways could be bolstering the role of that Legislative Design and Advisory Committee. This is something that the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment submitted on. Another one would be not to be using all-stages urgency for bills that have nothing to do with emergencies or any sort of national security, because all-stages urgency means that when the ACT Minister comes in with a pay equity bill, we don't see it until she stands up and starts speaking on it, we go to the table and pick up that bill, and then we go through all the stages of that legislation at once. That is a disgraceful and stupid way to make legislation, whatever you think of the policy. So, we will repeal this bill. It is a terrible bill.\n\nDAN BIDOIS (National—Northcote): For the members' benefit, I just want to highlight the purpose of this bill, which is to hold power to account and to raise the standard of lawmaking and policy making in this country. I think we've all got great examples from across the House of poor policy that we've seen, and the purpose of this bill is to strengthen that. That's why this bill sets out standard principles for good regulation. It sets out a process that it needs to go through and sets out a regulatory standards board to provide a way for Kiwis to have their say on bad and poor regulation, and it ensures that Ministers and agencies take their obligations seriously.As a member of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, it was good to hear those that came before us. I wish to thank those submitters. We did make some changes to this bill, and I look forward to debating those throughout the stages. But I wish to clear up some mistruths about this bill that have been fed from the other side. The first is that this takes away the sovereignty of Parliament. It does not take away the sovereignty of Parliament. There's nothing in this bill that prevents us from passing legislation, and, with that, I commend this bill to the House.\n\nHon PEENI HENARE (Labour): I normally have a lot of respect for Mr Bidois on matters relating to this particular bill and other bills that we've debated in this House, but Mr Bidois, in his speech to the House this afternoon, made it very clear he didn't listen to the vast majority of submitters who opposed this bill. Making good legislation in this House is about making legislation for the people. How is it that over 98 percent of those who submitted on this bill opposed this bill, and yet the Government continues to push on with its legislation agenda, of which the Regulatory Standards Bill is one?Every bill in this House has a whakapapa—it has a history—and it's easy to start at the Treaty principles bill, but I won't do that. For context, the history of this bill started in the negotiations between the National Party and the ACT Party, where the National Party and the ACT Party in their coalition agreement came up with the Regulatory Standards Bill. Now, I could go back a little bit further, to past iterations of the ACT Party in Government where they tried to do a very similar thing. It still got the cut then, and yet this ACT Party continues with it to this day. The National-led Government under Christopher Luxon negotiated, in their negotiations for the coalition, to have this bill come into the House. Now, how is it, then, that on that side of the House they can stand there hand on heart and say \"We are making legislation for the people.\", when the people clearly do not agree with it?Moving on to the heritage of this bill, the perennial beat-down on Māori in this country has been nothing but absolutely revolting from this Government from the time that they took office in 2023, and, yes, it did start with the Treaty principles bill. When they say, on that side of the House, \"We're here for efficiencies to make Government work better.\", well, they tried to push through a bill that wasted taxpayers' dollars on a process that was never ever going to get across the line, yet we had to suffer the division forced on our communities, and we continue to do so with this particular bill.Now, if the Minister today had stood up and said, \"I heard all of the great suggestions from those who made submissions on this bill and we've incorporated some of those into the next iteration of this bill, in its second reading.\", well, we might have listened a little bit more. But, in reading the legislative statement today, what we see here is not only are there minor amendments; one of them actually continues to rub the salt in the wounds of Māori, who have only just recently suffered under the passing of the marine and coastal area (MACA) legislation in this House.The legislative statement quite clearly says here that \"A clarification has been made to provide a consistent approach to excluding legislation that gives effect to customary marine title under the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011\". Well, why don't you rub it in? Why don't you rub the salt in the wound, when this House has already gone and done that and made it even harder for anyone to try and seek customary title under the MACA legislation?Now, we have a reminder here, in the second reading of this bill, in the Minister's legislative statement, where he, in an attempt to try and assuage the voter out there, has said, \"Oh well, we've excluded those who have already been recognised under the MACA.\" Well, I'd ask this House: how many of those who have sought customary title have been recognised under MACA? No, people across this House probably don't know the answer, but I can tell you that I'm aware of only one, and that is the settlement that was reached with Ngati Porou. There's another attempt by this Minister and this particular bill to say, \"There's nothing to see here. We still want to respect individual property rights.\", but that, actually, is not what's happening here. We know that what this Government has done, with the way that they've passed their bills, that it is a challenge to the democratic processes of this House. How many times have members in this House sat on select committees where the process has been truncated in this term? Far too many—in fact, more than I've experienced in the three terms prior to this term. Hon Rachel Brooking: That's if it goes to select committee.Hon PEENI HENARE: That's how many, and my colleague here made the very good point that when you rush things under urgency, nobody gets to see the bill. Members don't even get to see the bill until it's tabled in the House. Well, if we don't get to see it, that means the people of this country don't get to see it, and that side of the House wants to talk to us about good lawmaking? They want to talk to us about good democratic processes? Well, this is another affront to the democratic processes of this House and the ones that I know New Zealanders believe in, right up and down this country. We will repeal this legislation when we get the opportunity, and we do not support it.\n\nCATHERINE WEDD (National—Tukituki): Look, red tape and regulation has been holding this country back for far too long—much of it introduced under that previous Government. We need to get rid of the unnecessary red tape holding our farmers and our growers, our primary sector, our horticulture sector back. We need to get the wheels moving. We need transparent regulation, smarter regulation, and less regulation so that we can strengthen this economy and lift wages for everyone. I commend this bill to the House.\n\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): The introduction of this bill tells us that the \"bill seeks to support the Executive's accountability to Parliament for developing high-quality legislation and exercising stewardship over regulatory systems.\" This is Government that we have seen over the last two years flout their responsibility as a Government to have proper scrutiny of the regulations that have been put in place. We have had unprecedented numbers of bills coming to this House without regulatory impact statements. This is a Government that can't even use the existing apparatus that exists to ensure that we are making good laws in this House. We've had member after member on the Government backbenches jumping up and defending laws that they have no idea about the impact of, because none of us in this House do, because this is a Government that has just blatantly disregarded its responsibility when it comes to oversight of our regulatory systems in this country.Now, we are not supporting this bill; my colleagues have made that clear. In fact, the Labour Party has made this clear at every stage of this piece of legislation. It is a deeply flawed and ideologically driven bill. It is an example, yet again, of the tail wagging the dog. This is where David Seymour got one over Christopher Luxon in the coalition arrangements and shows, yet again, what weak leadership we have from our Prime Minister—what weak leadership we have from the National Party in terms of standing up for what is right and what is wrong. I feel sorry for the New Zealand First members. I suspect that they know that this is deeply flawed legislation but are being forced to vote for it because of their coalition arrangement.Let's go through and have a look at what this bill does. On the face of it, we see what—it sets out the principles about what we should be taking into account when we make law. It sets up a board that is appointed by David Seymour, and can be directed by David Seymour, to look into legislation. If we have a look at what this bill does, one of the things it does is it puts the primary of private interests over the collective interest at every point that it can.Now, let's consider what that could do. We had Transpower, for example, come and give a submission to the Finance and Expenditure Committee about clause 8(c) of the legislation that pointed out because of this regulation, if in the national interest we need to upgrade our power grid—which we will, we will need to put more infrastructure into place—that because of what is laid out in this bill, New Zealanders will pay more for their power; that there will be a requirement because of this legislation for compensation to be paid.Now, we see this in multiple ways. In fact, 98.7 percent of the people who came and submitted on this bill pointed out what problems there were with this legislation. I want to point out how wide the opposition was to this bill, how wide-ranging it was. We heard from the Law Society, we heard from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, we heard from iwi, we heard from groups that spanned a huge broad span of New Zealand society how problematic this piece of law is in so many ways. We heard from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment the way in which this legislation will impede our ability to make laws that protect our environment, to make laws that put in change the necessary provisions we need to do to counter climate change. These were things that we had respected bodies, like the Parliamentary Commission for the Environment, come and give their submissions of. We also heard from iwi repeatedly of the failure of this legislation to take into account the Treaty of Waitangi. This comes within a bundle of legislation that this Government have passed—not only with the Treaty Principles Bill, we've had the marine and coastal area legislation that my colleague, the Hon Peeni Henare, just talked about, that this really is part of the trifecta from this Government of having a complete attack on Māori and Treaty rights in this country.Now, under the shadow but trying to hide behind a fig leaf of good lawmaking, we have a Government that really is cutting to the heart of who we want to be as a country and what we want to be able to achieve with our legislation. That what we can see in terms of the rule of law, liberties, the taking of properties, taxes, fees and levies, the role of the courts, and good law making; these might seem on the face of it very sensible provisions. But we in no way are not saying that we should have proper transparency and oversight of the way in which we make law in this country. But we have a Government that can't even use the existing apparatus. Time and time again they've just bypassed the regulatory impact statement. They've brought legislation to this House that simply does not have that statement with it. The Cabinet hasn't considered regulatory impact statements when they're making decisions whether or not to progress legislation. Focus on individual liberty: this obsession that the ACT Party have got into the Government's agenda with this single focus on individual liberty does not recognise the duty that we have as lawmakers to protect a vast array of things for future generations—that it is our job as lawmakers to make sure that we are thinking beyond just the individual rights of a single entity or a single person and think about what we need to do to protect Aotearoa New Zealand and make sure that our children and our grandchildren can benefit from things. All of these things need to be considered when we are making laws.When we look at the submissions that we heard, as I said, 98.7 percent of the submissions opposed it. That should give a Government pause for thought, the fact there was overwhelming opposition to this bill. We weren't talking about just a small number of submissions. There were a very large number of submissions that came in. They went through an absolute range of things that could be put in place. One of the things, when we look at the taking of property principle that is in the legislation, it is unworkable. We heard this time and time again from those who came and submitted to the select committee, suggesting that a property right should not be impaired without fair compensation. This is what is in the legislation: where that impairment of property rights benefits one person but causes a detriment, the person who benefits should provide compensation.One of the questions that we asked, and Government members on the committee refused to engage with, is: what about laws that we make in this country around healthy homes? What about where we say that, actually, people deserve the right to live in a home that does not make them sick. That as legislators we should have the ability to actually legislate to say there are minimum standards around the homes that we allow people to live in so that we don't add to the health burden of this country and to the detriment of individual's health. What about swimming pool fences? Now, this will probably be something that will excite David Seymour a great deal—in terms of the reason why we have laws around we may do safety measures like this. This is in terms of the taking of property principle. These are where we are thinking about the collective benefit over that individual benefit. What about if a district plan would change to place height restrictions on a building to preserve the sunlight to a neighbouring building that would impair one landowner's property rights for another's benefit? That's clearly unreasonable to expect the neighbour to compensate the owner of the restricted land. These are all the kinds of issues that were raised at select committee of why this bill is unworkable.This is a piece of law that is simply the ACT Party flexing its muscle with a weak majority party within a coalition that has no ability to stand up for New Zealanders and is letting New Zealanders down. New Zealanders are being stuck with a piece of legislation that is to their detriment.\n\nDr HAMISH CAMPBELL (National—Ilam): Excellent, I have the 12th spot in this debate, and we have heard a lot of hyperbole and a lot of rubbish in this debate. This bill is very clear: it aims to bring the same discipline to regulation that some argue we already accept and expect in our fiscal management. It aims to set clear principles for good regulation, and then requires Ministers and agencies to disclose and explain any inconsistencies. The board's advice to Parliament is non-binding, contrary to what we've heard. It cannot strike down laws. Urgent or exceptional laws can still proceed, but departures must be transparent and justified. This is about transparency and holding the executive to account.\n\nASSISTANT SPEAKER (Greg O'Connor): The question is that the amendments recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Committee by majority be agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendments be agreed to.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15 Te Pāti Māori 6.Amendments agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That the Regulatory Standards Bill be now read a second time.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Motion agreed to.Bill read a second time.ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Greg O'Connor): I declare the House in committee for consideration of the Education and Training Amendment Bill (No 2) and the Medicines Amendment Bill.\n\nHOUSE IN COMMITTEECHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Members, the House is in committee on the Education and Training Amendment Bill (No 2) and the Medicines Amendment Bill.\n\nEDUCATION AND TRAINING AMENDMENT BILL (NO 2)In CommitteePart 1  Amendments to principal Act, and Schedule 1CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): We come first to the Education and Training Amendment Bill (No 2), and we begin with the debate on Part 1. Part 1 is the debate on clauses 4 to 29, \"Amendments to principal Act\", and Schedule 1. The question is that Part 1 stand part.\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Kia ora and good evening, Madam Chair and members of the Parliament. Before we begin the committee's discussion this evening, I just wanted to open the debate by once again thanking members of the public who provided their comments on this bill, and I also thank the members of this House who were sitting on the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The feedback that we received has been valuable in helping us better understand differing viewpoints and shaping a more structured and informed discussion today. As I mentioned during the second reading, this bill introduces several important changes that advance the Government's commitment to improving student achievement. It requires that school boards will make educational achievement their paramount or highest priority or objective. It also strengthens initial teacher education, ensures teacher discipline and competence processes are fit for purpose, and provides clear procedures for managing industrial action within the school system, alongside other improvements to the education system.One of those key proposals in this bill is to amend section 127 so that educational achievement and attainment becomes a school board's paramount objective. It is the highest priority in school governance. By placing student achievement right at the heart of what boards should focus on, we are supporting schools to return to the fundamentals of education and get them right. This change ensures that every learner can gain the knowledge, the skills, and the competencies they need to reach their full potential.The bill also includes proposals aligned with other key Government priorities, including raising our national student attendance. To support this, the bill introduces new requirements for schools to have attendance management plans that set out how the school will respond to and address the diverse underlying causes of non-attendance. My colleague the Associate Minister of Education, David Seymour, will also speak to and address questions in the committee that anyone may have on these proposals.Similarly, the bill also introduces a proposal to require universities to protect and promote academic freedom and freedom of expression in universities. It's vital that universities remain spaces that foster debate, encourage ongoing learning, and expose students to a diverse range of viewpoints so that they can develop into the critical thinkers that we need. My colleague the Minister for Universities, Minister Reti, will speak and address questions on this proposal.Alongside the proposals in the bill, I'm also announcing that I'll be introducing two Amendment Papers during our discussion in the committee today. The first Amendment Paper proposes to rebalance the Teaching Council's membership. It proposes a majority of ministerially appointed members by removing the teacher education position and adding a ministerially appointed member. This change will help ensure that appointed appointments are focused on professionalising the council and strengthening its strategic capability to more effectively perform its key regulatory function.The second Amendment Paper relates to additional changes to school board objectives in section 127, and it responds to the Government's Treaty reference review. During this review, concerns were raised about whether it is appropriate for boards to be held accountable for meeting the Crown's obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi. School boards are made up of parents and community members, who volunteer their time to support and run their local schools. This Government does not believe that it is reasonable to expect these parents, who are, effectively, volunteers, to carry legal responsibilities that rightly belong to the Crown. This Amendment Paper proposes the removal of the explicit requirement for boards to give effect to the Treaty of Waitangi from section 127. It's replaced by explicit objectives for school boards to seek equitable outcomes for Māori students, to take all reasonable steps to provide for te reo Māori, and to reflect the school community's cultural diversity in its policies and practices.Given that my colleagues Minister Seymour and, shortly—I hope—Minister Reti are here to speak to the attendance management plans and the freedom of expression proposals, I'd welcome members' questions on these proposals first. Then I can speak and answer questions from members on the other proposals in the bill, as well as the Amendment Papers.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Point of order, Mr Chairperson. Thank you, Mr Chair. I just wanted to get a clarification from the Minister of Education. Right at the end of her speech, the Minister's recommendation was that we look at the questions on universities and attendance plan, etc., first, before coming down to other things like section 127, which is within her mandate—or is it that anything goes? I just wanted to check.CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Well, just before I call the Minister, it's up to the members to ask whatever question they like. However, it's up to the Minister, if she can give any indication—Hon Erica Stanford: Yes. CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): But the questions will be—SHANAN HALBERT (Labour): Speaking to the point of order—thank you, Mr Chair. I'm just seeking your guidance on this and the follow-up. Given that the Minister of Education has indicated that Minister Reti will be arriving to respond to the freedom of expression component in Part 1, how does the Minister—or yourself, as Chair—recommend that we ask questions based on that, given that the Minister hasn't arrived at this stage? Should we postpone those questions, or how would—CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Well, I would suggest that if members want the best answer from the Minister, they would probably be able to observe whether the Minister is here or not. I would say, looking at the bill, that there is plenty of material that will lead up to the arrival, or otherwise, of any Minister. SHANAN HALBERT (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair. I just wouldn't want to miss the opportunity to ask the Minister for Universities directly—as outlined by the Minister of Education—the questions we need to, relative to this bill. So I just seek that commitment. CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Well, once again, the questions will be actually through this Minister, and, generally, she will play something of a puppet master around how the other Ministers—the first questions, generally, are primarily directed through her. I'm sure she will be very quick to direct questions to other Ministers where she believes they have greater expertise or can provide a better answer than she can.\n\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Tēnā koe e te Māngai o te Whare. Despite the Minister of Education's preference to deal with attendance and universities from the outset, we actually can't do that, because the Minister for Universities is not here, and I'm a bit worried that the jumping all over the place is going to make it difficult for us to track what has been covered off and what hasn't been covered off. I want to say that I think, when we look at the bill, there's actually a quite thematic approach that we should be taking to this, because the clauses are—for example, issues that we want to raise around the National Education and Learning Priorities (NELPs) and Te Tiriti in clause 8 and clause 9 also come under clause 127; attendance is in clause 9 and clause 23; universities are in clauses 12, 7, and 11; and then we have the Teaching Council later on. So I propose I would like to make my contributions along the lines of a thematic approach, and the Minister can figure out who needs to answer what questions, depending on what we all put to her in our contributing speeches.I want to start by saying that the Minister, in her opening speech, acknowledged the public and the submissions process, but what she failed to do in that acknowledgment is actually acknowledge that the majority of submissions were opposed to these proposed changes; in fact, 80.5 percent of the submissions disagreed with the proposal to make educational achievement the primary objective. So the Minister, on the one hand, thanks the public for participating in this process, and then—typical of this Minister—she absolutely ignores them. She ignores the submissions that they've given and the feedback that they've given back and continues to push ahead anyway, always so dismissive of the points that they're making.I would also make the point that these changes are not based on evidence; they are based on the Government having a coalition agreement between the National Party and the ACT Party. It is, in fact, in there that this is the baseless politicisation of education in Aotearoa, which is a troubling trend with this Government, including the latest Amendment Paper that we have received this afternoon about removing Te Tiriti o Waitangi provisions for the board. What we have here is that the Government has a very narrow and antiquated view of education, which is fitting for this Government because they have little interest in meaningful engagement and collaboration with the sector.My question to the Minister is: where is the evidence of the collaboration with the sector on the changes that she is making—which is acknowledged and, actually, it is being celebrated by the Hon David Seymour, who is saying this is a win for them because this is something that they campaigned on and that they put in their coalition agreement. So my question to the Minister is: where is the evidence of her engagement and collaboration with the sector on these proposed changes?What we have here is a very simplistic solution that is not evidence-based. While the Ministry of Education and the Minister of Education portrayed a view that nothing will change under the new drafting, there is a reason why statutory interpretation actually exists, and the changes to section 127 do have interpretation repercussions.In that first contribution, I just want to know, given that the Minister acknowledged the public and the effort that they went to to make submissions into this process, why she ignored that the majority of them were opposed to these proposed changes, and what evidence can she give this committee of the whole House of the collaboration that she did with the sector?\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Sorry, Mr Chair, the Minister was just getting up to respond. [Member is given the call] OK. Right, so, like the previous speaker the Hon Willow-Jean Prime mentioned, we are going to take quite a thematic approach, and I think this bill does lend itself to that quite nicely.We are starting with replacement section 127, inserted by clause 8—and just a signal to the Chair as well that we will then move on to attendance, universities, and the Teaching Council, in that particular order.Now, starting with section 127, I also want to signal to the chair that the Minister has released a very substantial Amendment Paper yesterday, without public consultation, without notifying anyone. Usually it has been the case in the past that when Ministers do bring a bill or have those Amendment Papers, that they at least make the House aware that a certain Amendment Paper has been released, as a sign of good faith. But we also didn't really see that. So I really want to just request to the Chair that we do need to, because it is substantial, be given the full opportunity to examine this, as well as where the intention of this particular amendment came from. I think I'm referring to Amendment Paper 408. So on section 127, this is clause 8 we're looking at and this is something that we sort of never got clarity on despite the select committee stage, and I understand the Minister's position is that we want to have a single paramount objective, but then the Minister was also like, \"Nothing is going to change.\" So the question then is why make that change if nothing is going to change? If we are making that change, having the singular paramount objective, then something would be changed in terms of how the board is going to work. So if something is going to change, then could the Minister walk us through, operationally, on how school boards are expected to see that change?That's my first question for the Minister and I do want to touch on, I guess, one of the bigger questions—and I also have an amendment to this particular section as well, which I will mention later, but I want to touch on the second question, which is on the Minister's Amendment Paper 428. So this is the Amendment Paper that came in yesterday, and this is the troubling amendment where the Minister has removed Te Tiriti o Waitangi, specifically the giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi in new section 127(2)(e).While I understand the Minister is saying that, \"Oh well, some of the criteria are still there.\"; that's very different to giving effect to Te Tiriti, because giving effect to Te Tiriti is far more holistic than that. So other than what the Minister has just mentioned before, what sort of advice has the Minister received? I also want to look to the Minister who, in this case is also responsible for—hold on, let me just quickly check; it is in clause 11 of the Education and Training Amendment Bill. Nope, it's not in that one. I'll try to find it in another contribution, but I guess the question is: where is this coming from in terms of the removal of Te Tiriti? But also, more importantly, what we also want to check with the Minister is what consultation has she then undertaken with the New Zealand School Boards Association, noting that the school boards are going to be the ones who are implementing this. I'll leave those two questions for the time being. So exactly what is being changed? Walk us through the operational aspect and where did this amendment come from?\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): In relation to the first question that was questioning the consultation, there has been consultation on section 127. There was public consultation on the proposal to amend section 127 and to remove the National Education and Learning Priorities provisions from the Act between 2 September and 14 October 2024. The Ministry of Education consulted in 2024 on section 127, making achievement paramount—Hon Willow-Jean Prime: And what was the advice? Hon ERICA STANFORD: —before introducing the bill, so—she asked specifically about consultation.Just making some comments in relation to the second question about the process, I'd just like to point out that the process is that the Amendment Paper should go up I think 24 hours beforehand—which it did, yesterday afternoon—and from all my time on the Opposition benches, the job of the Opposition was to keep an eye on the website to make sure that any Amendment Papers were brought to their attention. That's certainly how it's been working since 2017, and so that's what the member should do.In addressing the point around evidence, the evidence is that there have been decades of decline in student achievement, and I know that it hurts the Opposition—especially Willow-Jean Prime—to know that they had six years in Government and didn't manage to raise achievement for tamariki Māori, or any students, at all. I know that that hurts, and I know that it hurts that in 18 months, we have managed to raise the early achievement of phonics and reading for Māori students—Hon Willow-Jean Prime: Oh, tell us about that data. Hon ERICA STANFORD: —in just 18 months, and I love it that then they have to say, \"Oh, it must be the dodgy data.\" That's where they always have to go to. Well, I know that it hurts—[Interruption] CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Ms Prime, the good thing about being in the committee stage is that you'll get a chance to go to your feet and respond to this, rather than have a continual barrage.Hon ERICA STANFORD: But the point of this change is so that we are all rowing in the same direction, that achievement is the paramount objective of school boards, that we are being very clear and concise in our directions on what boards must do in order to raise achievement for Māori students and achieve equitable outcomes, to make sure that they are offering te reo Māori, to make sure that they are then culturally competent in their schools. We are still being very directive, but what we are doing is saying that the Crown holds the duty when it comes to our Treaty obligation. It was signed between the Crown and iwi Māori. We take that very seriously, which is why we have made sure that every resource that we have produced in English has been also provided in te reo Māori, and that every single professional learning and development, every single resource, and every single policy has also been made available for kura kaupapa and available for Māori immersion units. That's why we are seeing an increase in Māori achievement.It is not the job of well-meaning parents who run schools who are effectively volunteers to be deferred a Treaty duty. Do you know what happened in the last six years since that's happened? Nothing. Student results didn't get any better. I know that that hurts and I know that it hurts that under our Government they have finally started to turn a corner, but when you focus on achievement and have everybody focused on that and following the evidence and the science as to what works, that's what happens. Virtue signalling and empty words smattered around don't actually raise student achievement. The core tenet—the core tenet—of our Treaty obligation as the Crown is to raise tamariki Māori achievement. Unfortunately, the previous Government couldn't do that, and that hurts.\n\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair, and thank you for pointing out that I get a chance in my contributions to respond to the Minister of Education and her virtue signalling about her recent results. I mean, I've seen so much feedback from the sector on those results that the Minister is boasting about, and I do question the robustness of that. I do question the methodology behind it. So maybe if the Minister would like to answer those questions, in terms of that data that she is boasting about.The Minister said that they consulted on these proposed changes in new section 127, inserted by clause 8. I asked the Minister: what was the result of that consultation; what feedback did she get and did the ministry get from the sector around the things that they consulted on before bringing this bill to the House? The Minister didn't talk to any of that, conveniently. She also, conveniently, does not acknowledge that in the public consultation process in select committee that the majority of those that submitted opposed what is being proposed here. So she has this consultation. She ignores all of the feedback. She carries on and pushes ahead anyway.One of the things in this bill that they are proposing to do is to repeal—to repeal—the provisions around the NELPs, that's the National Education and Learning Priorities. This is in clause 5. Those National Education and Learning Priorities were actually developed through extensive consultation with the sector, something this Minister doesn't like to do.Hon Erica Stanford: No, I like to raise achievement.Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: No, you don't like to work with—the Minister does not like to work in consultation with the sector. It says that they provide crucial strategic guidance to school boards about areas such as putting learners at the centre; barrier-free access to learning; quality teaching and leadership; and the future of learning and work; and creating a world-class, inclusive, public education system. They are only in place in the Act where children's participation and decision making is required. Does the Minister care about the children and the students at all? Does she care about what they think? What consultation has she done with the children about anything that she has proposed in here?My question, because the point that stakeholders made is that they do not believe that it is necessary to repeal this provision within the Act—so why is the removal necessary when it is not a requirement to issue a NELP but only an option for the Minister is they choose? Why does she want to get rid of something that the sector supports—that, in fact, the sector was involved in the development of, because she doesn't seem to like working collaboratively with the sector and respecting anything that they may have worked on and put forward. So why is the removal of this necessary?\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Interestingly, while submitters on this issue to the bill disagreed with the proposal to remove them, the School Boards Association did their own survey of school board members—so this is more like the public; you could imagine parents and people who are serving on school boards. The survey received 55 percent agreeing with the removal of the NELP. So there is a diversity of views out there.But the views of this Government are that, yes, the previous Government did spend a long time on the NELP, around two years, consulting fully and creating another strategic document—they created many of them—in the end that only required school boards and others to \"have regard to\". So it was a document that they spent a very, very long time on that actually was replicated in many, many other areas and documents that was their work programme. But we have an urgent issue. We have got plummeting student achievement. If the member opposite and her previous Government had spent more time focusing on the children and their outcomes, rather than all of these strategic documents that didn't actually do anything, maybe student achievement would have improved in the six years under their watch, but it didn't.We have used a different vehicle for our six priority areas. Many of the things that are outlined in the NELP are already replicated elsewhere. It is a document that people don't have to give regard to or don't have to follow if they don't want to. We have our work programme. It is outlined in our Cabinet paper and in our press release and shown to the sector on many occasions. I talk about it often; it will never change, our six key priority areas to drive achievement. They're already having an impact.Again, I'll say to the member: I know that it's tough to see this Government raising achievement, when they spent six years with a whole lot of documents and strategies that didn't go anywhere, but that's just really unfortunate.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. I also want to get some guidance from you, Mr Chair. We have heard the Minister of Education, rather than responding to the questions on this particular bill, spending an inordinate amount of time actually attacking the previous Government. So I'm just checking with you, Mr Chair, that if we are opening up shop for political hot takes, then there are a lot of things we could also be saying. But I would like to speak very closely to the bill.CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Well, I'll just answer that question. The Minister is aware that the wider her answers, the more material then comes within scope for those asking the questions. It's been a fairly broad-based debate to date. It is a little bit more difficult to direct to specific parts, probably, while the Minister's answers remain as broad as they do, because there is always going to be that wider scope. Carry on, Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan.Dr LAWRENCE XU-NAN: Thank you, Mr Chair. And I think it is important, and what the Minister is saying is important, but I want to look at a few things that I asked before.One of the things I asked is when it comes to the removal of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and potential legal obligations. Let me just say then, the president of the School Boards Association has come out, and I wondered—the first question is around how the Minister keeps on talking about \"core Crown\". The term \"core Crown\" has never come up anywhere else that I know of, so if the Minister wouldn't mind first defining what she means by \"Crown\", because school boards themselves are Crown entities—in effect, school boards are the Crown. So if the Minister is saying that we don't want school boards, as Crown entities, to be in charge of overseeing student work—and let's say schools already have a number of obligations, responsibilities, and accountabilities. We have seen that in the past, school boards have been charged with neglect. So school boards already have to do that. By giving effect to Te Tiriti, it doesn't actually mean what the Minister thinks that it means. So I just want to check, just clarify: what is \"core Crown\", and is the Minister aware that school boards are Crown entities and they do have a legal obligation as well?Which then comes to my second question around Te Tiriti, which is: have the Ministers consulted with the Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti? Because in section 6 of the Education and Training Act, they do give allowances for the Minister to actually collaborate with the Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti on certain announcements. I would assume that the removal of Te Tiriti o Waitangi is probably quite a big one to consult with the Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti on. So I'm just checking if the Minister has consulted with the other responsible Minister in this area, on this, and whether the Minister will see this potentially open up to things like, you know, a Waitangi Tribunal application. Because, again, we do, broadly, have an obligation in Aotearoa for things like the inclusion and, in this case, the removal of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It's not just simply something that the Minister can drop the day before. So that's my third question.On to consultation. I'm glad that the Minister quoted the consultation that she did, and I'm actually very pleased with that consultation. Hats off to the Minister for being one of the few Ministers that released an exposure draft bill. But in that consultation, in terms of making student outcomes the primary objective, the opposition rate—because the Minister cares about numbers, when she quoted 55 percent of school boards didn't like the National Education and Learning Priorities—80.5 percent of the submitters did not agree with making education outcomes the primary objective for section 127. Then, if we're moving on to the select committee stage, 94 percent of the submitters to the Education and Workforce Committee did not agree, or were opposed, to this particular section of making student outcomes paramount in the bill.I know that it does hurt the Minister to consider that the way that we're looking at student outcomes is the be all and end all, but at the same time, if this Minister spends some time in front of a classroom, I feel like that it is a little bit different and it can almost be considered hubris for the Minister to not actually take the advice of the sector with something like this. So that's my third question: if the Minister truly did consult, then why has the Minister not taken on board the other numbers that didn't necessarily agree with her agenda?\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): I'll attempt to answer all of those—there are a number of questions there. Firstly, the core Crown—i.e., the Government of the day and central government agencies—are parties to the Treaty. The explicit duty for school boards to give effect to the Treaty is being removed in recognition that schools are not part of the core Crown. Yes, there are some Crown entities that have Treaty obligations, but school boards are very, very different than any of those. They are predominantly made up of parents who are, essentially, volunteers, who have a range of things that they need to achieve in the governance of their school. We don't, as a Government, and this Cabinet has decided that the core Crown has the duty with iwi Māori in relation to the Treaty of Waitangi and that it is not up to a school board to try to decipher how to give effect to the Treaty. We are, instead, being very clear with school boards: what are the things that you need to do around language, cultural competence, and ensuring that there are equitable outcomes for tamariki Māori so that they are very clear and not having to try and decipher what giving effect to the Treaty is, because that is the job of the Crown; that is the decision of Cabinet.In relation to the second part of the question and some idea that I don't spend time in classrooms, I spent a lot of time in classrooms and with students and talking to teachers and talking to parents—Hon Member: More than anyone—more than anyone.Hon ERICA STANFORD: Yes, I'd say you're right, probably more than anybody in this House. It is one of my very, very favourite jobs. But it's also important to not that, yes, there were people who submitted on the bill, there are also a number of other stakeholders in New Zealand, like parents. There are tens of thousands of parents who expect this Government to make sure that when their child turns up to school that they get the very best world-leading education and that they reach their full potential at school. Now, for too long, as I mentioned, those results have been declining, nobody has managed to turn it around. We have a plan, we're putting it in place, we're already seeing the early results of that, and we are unashamedly making sure that when children turn up to school that we turn those results around because, if we don't, then, the future of this country is not in a good space.There may have been a third question that I've missed, and if the questioner wants to raise it again, I'll answer it, because I don't remember what that was.\n\nHon PHIL TWYFORD (Labour—Te Atatū): Thank you, Mr Chair. I have some questions for the Minister on these provisions that we're discussing. The first is: does she accept that Te Tiriti is the country's founding document? Does she accept that Te Tiriti has constitutional status in New Zealand? Does she think it's inappropriate or appropriate for our public school system to operate in accordance with Te Tiriti, particularly if she does regard it, in fact, as a constitutional document? Does she think that it's a zero-sum game that schools cannot chew gum and walk at the same time; that is, they cannot strive and improve educational achievement and do it while operating in a way that is consistent with Te Tiriti? And, if she does think it's a zero-sum game, and that any energy that a school puts into operating in a way that's consistent with Te Tiriti is energy that cannot be put into educational achievement, what evidence does she have to support that?\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): The member will be very aware that the Cabinet Manual sees the Treaty as a constitutional document, of course. Since 1989, we have had school boards, and we have not had a clause in any part of the Education Act which has conferred or deferred a Treaty obligation away from the Crown to a group of parents who are volunteers on school boards. Now, that change has only been in place for a few years. But I'd also say to the member, there is more than just—Hon Willow-Jean Prime: In recognition that it was failing.Hon ERICA STANFORD: You're going to have your say when you get to ask your question, so just [gestures for member to sit down] for a bit, all right?In answer to the member's questions around chewing gum and walking at the same time, there are many things in clause 8 replacing section 127 that we're asking the school board to do, not just to raise achievement. Around student safety and wellbeing, there's parts around making sure that they're turning up to school—attendance—and making sure that they're carrying out assessments. There are a huge amount of things.Not only that, but also we're being very, very clear about what school boards need to do, as I've already mentioned, in order to ensure that there are equitable outcomes for Māori students—that they're offering te reo Māori and that they're being culturally competent in the way that they operate in their school. So there are many things that we're asking the school boards to do, and being very particular, and some of those things are particular to tamariki Māori.But it is, as I've already said, the Crown's responsibility, and it's Cabinet's decision that it is the Crown's responsibility, to honour the Treaty and to make sure that we are abiding by that, and we're doing that in many ways. If you look at our entire work programme, everything we're doing is also in te reo Māori. As I've already mentioned: all of the resources, all of the professional learning and development (PLD). We're providing new assessments for assessing early readers' phonics ability in te reo Māori, which is why we're able to see where and when we need to intervene early for those students who are learning in te reo Māori and immersion units that are in kura kaupapa, so that we can intervene early to make sure that their reading is on track as well.As far back as I can see, no Government has ever mirrored their exact work programme to make sure that all of the resources, all of the PLD, everything that we're doing, every policy, are also there and available in te reo Māori for Māori students as well. And that is why we're starting to see a shift.Dr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Point of order. Thank you, Mr Chair. I want to say that I do take personal offence, under Standing Order 121, from the Minister for using te reo Māori when she is actively removing Te Tiriti o Waitangi from the legislation—Hon Members: Oh, sit down!Dr LAWRENCE XU-NAN: Shush, children! When someone is raising a point of order, it is heard in silence. Thank you. My point of order is that I do take personal offence, under Standing Order 121, for the Minister to use te reo Māori when she's actively removing Te Tiriti o Waitangi from the legislation, and I would like for her to withdraw and apologise.Hon Erica Stanford: Speaking to the point of order.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Yes, you can speak to the point of order, Hon Erica Stanford.Hon Erica Stanford: Madam Chair, it is very clear, in everything that we're doing, that we are supporting te reo Māori in schools, not only making sure that school boards have an obligation to make sure that they're offering te reo Māori but also making sure that everything is available in te reo Māori—more so than any Government ever, that I've been able to see. So there's no need for the member to take offence.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Is this a point of order, or?Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: No, this is a new call.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): A new call? OK. Hon Willow-Jean Prime—he ceded the call to you.\n\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. We've just had the Minister, once again, standing up and talking so proudly about her record of te reo Māori. My question to the Minister is: what gave the Minister the right to determine that Te Tiriti o Waitangi means providing resources in te reo Māori? Who gave the Minister and the Crown the sole right to determine that giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi is to simply provide resources in te reo Māori? Who did she talk to?Which iwi, which hapū who signed to Te Tiriti o Waitangi did the Minister talk to, to determine that in order to give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi all she has to do is give some resources and te reo Māori? The duties of the Crown to give effect to and honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi are far more than providing some resources in te reo Māori, OK? The Minister might want to address that one for us.But I want the Minister to also tell me how she can claim that providing resources in te reo Māori is giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi when she is also recolonising the curriculum, whitewashing the curriculum? Who was involved in the rewrite of that curriculum, minimising the use of te reo Māori, minimising Māori concepts and matauranga Māori in that curriculum`?Minister, as the Crown, who did you work with when working with your Treaty partners? Who did you consult? Who agreed that giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi was removing Māori words from 5-year-old students' readers? Can she tell me the answer to that one?Who did the Minister consult with when she decided that giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi meant removing $30 million of funding for Te Ahu o te Reo Māori, which is to train Māori teachers to be able to deliver?CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Can I stop the member for a moment and just ask which clauses you're referring to because I'm trying to find the scope of the questions that you're currently asking. So can you refer me to a clause? Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: Sure, yes. Replacement section 127, inserted by clause 8, the removal of giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Madam Speaker, for your benefit, prior to you arriving, the Minister made some quite broad contributions, and as the previous Chair pointed out, opened herself up to this very type of questioning and debate. So that was made very clear by the presiding officer who was here immediately prior to you.Now, the Minister, in her last contribution, as you were switching over, talked about how she was proud of this Government's record of giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the responsibility of the Crown by giving Māori resources to kids, by translating them. So, I am responding to that. The Minister stopped me as I was interjecting over here and said that I will get my turn. So, in my turn, I am asking the Minister to now answer the questions that she invited me to ask. CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Thank you for the recap. That's helpful in the changeover, thank you. Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: Now, I look forward to the Minister answering those questions. I also want the Minister to explain very clearly for the House—Cameron Luxton: And slowly for the member. Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: That's right—really slowly, really clearly, in real detail, what she understands the Crown's obligations to Māori under Te Tiriti o Waitangi are. And in the Cabinet Manual, what are the Crown's duties and obligations in education to give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi? What are the obligations of partnership? What are the obligations of active protection? What are the obligations of equity? Can the Minister please tell me what she understands her obligations are, as the Crown, in terms of Te Tiriti o Waitangi?Can the Minister then tell me how she intends to ensure that schools do this if the boards of trustees no longer have any responsibility under this legislation and the proposed removal of this requirement on them? The Minister is going to delegate duties to boards of trustees but not any responsibilities. So how is the Minister, who says she's going to retain that responsibility—what mechanism is she going to have in place to ensure that schools and boards of trustees are upholding her Treaty obligations? Because you're removing one of those provisions. So, can the Minister tell the House, this evening, how she intends to monitor that so that parents across Aotearoa know that she is not simply delegating authority to school boards with no responsibility and that it just falls through some gap, which I'm sure is actually one of the key objectives of this? How will you ensure that that is upheld?\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Going back to the start of that contribution where the member was asking around the provision of te reo resources—and this may go to part of my questions as to why the previous Government didn't do this; I'm now starting to understand it. But under the Waitangi Tribunal's decision, Wai 11—and the member would be advised to go and look at that decision, which says that treating te reo Māori as a taonga is important and that te reo Māori is, in fact, a taonga under the Treaty of Waitangi and it deserves active protection. The way that we do that in education is to make sure that we are providing resources, that there is bilingual education like the kura kaupapa and rumaki units, and that we are actively protecting the language, and a part of that is to provide resources. It's only one way, but it is an important way of making sure that we are actively protecting that taonga of te reo Māori, which is exactly what we're doing. There are a lot more things that we do in order to do that, but the member asked that particular question about resourcing.The member also went on to ask what I think honouring the Treaty means, and I've said this a number of times. In article 3 of the Treaty, it's very clear that the rights and responsibilities are given to Māori as they are British citizens, if you take the literal reading of the Treaty of Waitangi. That means, when we think about education, that tamariki Māori are receiving an education and they have equitable outcomes. That is why that yawning gap between Māori achievement and non-Māori achievement over so many decades has meant that we haven't been doing all we can do to uphold that part of the Treaty, which is why I am so focused on every single thing that I do in the mainstream to make sure we're also doing it in te reo Māori. All of the things I've already mentioned, I won't go over them again, but we are also being very clear with school boards. As I've already said, it's very vague to say to a school board that you need to give effect to the Treaty of Waitangi, because what does that mean, in effect, for a school board? And I'll tell you what, the member opposite hasn't actually said what she thinks that it means. We are being very, very clear. We are saying that you must offer te reo Māori when students request it; you must make sure that you are attempting to achieve equitable outcomes for tamariki Māori, and you must make sure that you are being culturally competent: very clear and specific to boards so they know exactly what they need to do. It's all very well to just put words in without actually being clear about what they mean, because what happens is that boards lose their focus, and we want them to be laser focused on raising achievement, closing the equity gap, and doing those things to raise Māori achievement. That's what we're focused on doing.\n\nCUSHLA TANGAERE-MANUEL (Labour—Ikaroa-Rāwhiti): Tēnā koe e te Māngai o te Whare. Tēnā koe e te Minita. Otirā, tēnā tātou katoa. It's my pleasure to stand here as the presiding member of te kura kaupapa Māori o Taperenui a Whatonga to seek further clarification around section 127. Beyond te reo and beyond resources, can the Minister of Education accept that giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi looks different according to iwi, hapū, community, and the tikanga and kawa processes of that iwi, hapū, and community? If so, how can the Minister monitor effectiveness and, of course, ensure consistency? I mean, I'm yet to hear a good argument about why we're honestly mucking around with Te Tiriti o Waitangi.[Authorised reo Māori text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.][Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]It's absolutely unnecessary. To simply say that if someone wants access to their reo, to their culture, they can request it, already disenfranchised people are not going to do that. They are going to sit—Hon David Seymour: Why not?CUSHLA TANGAERE-MANUEL: [Authorised reo Māori text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.][Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]—because they've been downtrodden by ridiculous laws like this. That's why Te Tiriti being in these documents is so important, so ignoramuses can't detach people from their culture and their reo. But the question is: how can a Government asking stupid questions like that give us any comfort?CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Direct the questions to the Minister and less of this pointing, thank you.CUSHLA TANGAERE-MANUEL: How can anyone in this country feel reassured that Te Tiriti will be honoured when we've got Government Ministers making silly quips like that about the value of Te Tiriti and access to te reo and tikanga and identity?So in simplistic terms, how will the Minister monitor the effectiveness of this? What qualifies the Minister to ensure Te Tiriti will be given effect across schools across Aotearoa and therefore how will she ensure the consistency when the delivery giving effect to this will look different and it should look different in every school community, and that's what boards can be charged with. Tēnā tātou.\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): One of the easiest ways to ensure that you are raising achievement—which is, again, the core tenet of a Treaty duty: to make sure that tamariki Māori are succeeding to their full potential, which we have not done in this country for some time—is to make sure that we're assessing our young people. That's why we created Hihira Weteoro, which is a phonics check that is designed specifically—a world first, as far as we can tell—for Māori children learning in bilingual units. It tests them at 20 weeks, 40 weeks, and 55 weeks—understanding that they are learning in a bilingual environment, in some cases, or in full immersion—to make sure that they are staying on track with their learning. Where they fall behind, we pick them up with our literacy intervention teachers and programmes that we have put in place, which are very, very important.What we're also doing is making sure that, for the first time—this has never been done before; the previous Government didn't do this—we're actually assessing. Taking a sample assessment in our Curriculum Insights and Progress study, where we take samples of children in years 3, 6, and 8 in the mainstream and assess them in reading, writing, and maths to make sure that they're on track and that Government policies are working—for the first time, we're going to be doing that in immersion settings as well.So the best way to make sure that we are achieving equitable outcomes is to actually ask the question, are we? We haven't done that before. We haven't had really good data across our mainstreaming and immersion units.Also, from next year, there will be a requirement to assess, using one of the three assessment tools, reading, writing, and maths, twice a year, every year, from year 3. So it will be very telling how achievement is going and whether or not we are making sure that there are equitable outcomes for Māori students.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Can I just say, before we take some more questions for the Minister, that we've spent a reasonable amount of time around clause 8 replacing section 127 and the Minister has been answering the questions all the way through. The members may not like some of the answers, but the Minister has actually been answering. So it'd be really good if we could branch out to see if there's anything else in this piece of legislation.Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Point of order, Madam Chair. Thank you for that. I do just want to check your understanding, though, because this Amendment Paper that has been introduced around Te Tiriti—the removal of the requirements for giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi—has not been to select committee. This is our only opportunity to ask the Minister questions about this specific point. There are other things in section 127 that did go to select committee, which we haven't addressed yet—CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): I get the point of order from the member. My judgment is that the questions that have been asked to this point about how the Minister is going to ensure and measure have been answered by the Minister. I'm looking for different questions because I feel like the questions since I've been in here for the last 20 minutes have been very similar questions and very similar answers to what I've already seen that the previous Chair has written down. I'm looking for you to broaden out. What I'm saying is you may not like the answer that the Minister's giving you, but it doesn't mean that she's not answering the question.\n\nSHANAN HALBERT (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate and respect your comments, and I'll do my best to add additional points. The problem here is that the Minister of Education has been quite narrow in her responses and that what we're trying to understand is, actually, how did this decision come about where, at the eighth hour, we've received an amendment; we've been through a select committee process; and our select committee actually does good, constructive, robust work; it wasn't a short process; and so there was every opportunity for the Minister to drop this particular amendment.It is a pattern of behaviour from this Government. This is not the first amendment that is dropped at the eighth hour to remove the Treaty of Waitangi; Minister Simmonds and Government colleagues did the same in the vocational training bill. So it's not new for the Government. It is part of the coalition agreement. So I am confused why the Government is, in fact, dropping such a large piece of discussion that is sensitive in nature and is the foundation document for our country at a late stage in this process. Hence why I'm sort of drilling into the Minister to say \"When did this amendment go to Cabinet and approved by Cabinet, was that this week?\"—just to understand why it's so late in the piece and what consultation keeps on coming up.But she actually hasn't identified for us which groups have been consulted around this particular amendment. It is the removal of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. I acknowledge that she is uncomfortable about doing this and probably is being wedged by the minor parties around her in this Government, the ACT Party and New Zealand First. This is their push, and she will be uncomfortable about this decision. But she is the boss here and she needs to answer these questions in this phase of scrutiny in the committee of the whole House.So which groups did the Minister actually consult with here, which Māori groups as well, and which schools, if any—if any—came back and said to the Minister \"This is a good thing, to put an amendment in place that removes Te Tiriti o Waitangi?\"The next layer of that is about understanding the rationale behind why this is important. The Minister has talked a lot about equity but we haven't unpacked the role that Te Tiriti plays in achieving equitable outcomes for tamariki in our education system. So the question arises: can equity be achieved without our foundation document underpinning the decision making at a governance level in our schools? If that is removed, how do we achieve true equity?The Minister, this afternoon, has come up with examples—some people call it cherry-picking—of the work that the Government is doing in te reo, and the like—which is fine, that's good; I respect those things that they are doing, but that is not equity. That is not equity, Minister—Hon Erica Stanford: What is it? Tell me.SHANAN HALBERT: —it is examples—I've still got a minute.Hon Erica Stanford: No, I mean, tell me what those things are.SHANAN HALBERT: My question here—it's my job to scrutinise you today, right?CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): The Minister's just asking the member to clarify what he meant by that last statement.SHANAN HALBERT: As I said—Camilla Belich: Point of order. Madam Chair, you'll know that there is a Standing Order which prohibits the Minister from utilising the microphone during the committee stage in order to insert comments into the debate. So I just appreciate—CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): I do understand that. I'm just trying to get the best answers out for the questions. If the Minister wants to clarify a question that somebody's asked, I think that's really important for the Minister to be able to answer the question. I don't believe she was injecting herself. I've seen Ministers inject themselves in the past; she was just trying to get some clarification.SHANAN HALBERT: Thank you, Madam Chair. The thing I'm trying to understand from the Minister is: what role does she see Te Tiriti o Waitangi playing in achieving equitable outcomes for tamariki in our education system? That has been removed.What has been done here is silencing of Māori voices around a governance group that runs our schools. I'd like her to give me an understanding of if she agrees that that is silencing Māori voices around that table and what's the impact of that.\n\nHon PHIL TWYFORD (Labour—Te Atatū): Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to say, Madam Chair, this is not repeating questions for the sake of it. I want to respond directly to something that the Minister didn't say in her failure to answer one of my previous questions, but also to respond to things that she actually has said.I finished my last intervention by asking the Minister to share with the House evidence that underpins—I think—her assertion that having the Treaty of Waitangi enshrined in this legislation is somehow a distraction, or detracts, from her objective—that, I think, is shared by everybody here—that we want to see tamariki Māori do as well as they possibly can in the education system. She doesn't answer that.Further, I want to take the Minister's claims at face value that she's committed to supporting the achievement of Māori in the education system, and she's investing and producing resources and so on; and, also at face value, the distinction that the Minister draws between achievement of Māori in the system and the inclusion of Te Tiriti in law. If I can paraphrase what I've heard from the Minister today, she's more interested in educational achievement than she is in, somehow, the kind of symbolism of having Te Tiriti in our education legislation.My question is: logically, why not do both? Why choose one over the other? Why not knock yourself out doing everything you can to encourage Māori to do as well as they possibly can in our education system, and have Te Tiriti enshrined in our law conveying to this and all future Governments our shared obligation to make sure that Māori see themselves reflected in everything we do in public life in this country? Why is she choosing one over the other?\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): The Treaty of Waitangi is enshrined in our legislation. It is deeply enshrined in the Education and Training Act in section 32, and I take that responsibility very seriously. But to have a clause and a board of trustees requirement that says they need to give effect to the Treaty, without actually being very clear on what that means—and it's very interesting that's the members are using words like \"true equity\" and \"really honouring the Treaty\", without even saying what it is that they think. The reason that they won't is because they've got the same problem that boards of trustees have; that they don't know what \"giving effect to the Treaty\" actually means.What we are being very clear on is what they need to do to seek to achieve equitable outcomes for Māori students: to take all reasonable steps to provide for teaching and learning in te reo Māori to students whose parents or caregivers request it; to take reasonable steps to ensure that the policies and practices for at school reflect New Zealand's cultural diversity. What we really need boards focused on is language, is culture, is making sure that students are achieving to the very highest possible of their abilities.But in section 32, deeply enshrined in our legislation, is the Treaty duty, which sits with the Crown, which has been guiding me in all of my policies and all of my decisions. The members opposite might not like to think that providing resources and professional learning and development and making sure that we are providing to Māori language skills to teachers—which we are about to commence with next year, as it was budgeted for this year; all the literacy resources we're providing to schools, secondary schools, kura kaupapa, whare kura—is important. Those things are very important to our Treaty obligation to make sure that we are revitalising the language and making sure that Māori students are reaching their full potential, and that is exactly what we are doing.But what we are saying to boards is, we don't expect you to sit around and try and work out what honouring or giving effect to the Treaty means—because if you want to talk about something being very unclear, that is exactly it. We need, and parents expect, boards of trustees to be laser focused on outcomes for students: getting them to school, making sure they're achieving to the highest possibility, and keeping them safe.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I also just wanted to mention to you, Madam Chair, with the previous Chair, we mentioned there are broader themes within this bill that we want to explore and we're on the section on the obligations of the board, but there is also the other sections of attendance, universities, and the Teaching Council.I want to just check with something that I asked the Minister of Education right at the beginning, which was around not so much broader consultation with the public but more consultation with, potentially, her Cabinet colleagues or with other officials.I think my first question would be: how come, particularly with some of these changes, we haven't seen a child impact statement being conducted, when this particular bill does affect children quite severely? In this case, in terms of a child impact statement, what sort of consultation, particularly with the latest amendment, Amendment Paper 428, that the Minister dropped, has been consulted through Mana Mokopuna, the Children's Commissioner? I think that's also a helpful indicator to the committee that the due diligence, even though we may not have seen it, has been done when introducing something like that into the committee.The other person that I checked with in terms of consultation, for the Minister, was the Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti. That was mainly from the perspective of what, then—I understand what the Minister is saying, the Treaty of Waitangi is available in clause 6, amending section 9, but anything that removes the giving effect of Te Tiriti o Waitangi within any legislation should have serious scrutiny. So I want to know whether the Minister for Māori Crown Relations has been consulted and what this would mean for Māori-Crown relations in general, and has the Minister received advice on what this would mean in terms of potentially an application to the Waitangi Tribunal?All of these included, when we're looking at replacement section 127, inserted by clause 8, I think a broader question that we haven't asked is: sure, the Minister wants to make sure that there is one single paramount objective, but with everything else we're talking about, were there actually other options that were being considered? The Minister has consistently mentioned that it was confusing, that boards are volunteers, and etc.—and I 100 percent agree with that, but, at the same time, what are some of the other ways for us to potentially reach the sort of ability for the school boards to be able to do their role as the governing body of a school by other means, by providing additional resources? Rather than kind of like saying \"You only need to focus on one thing, because you are volunteers and you don't have the capacity.\", was there any option being considered that would give them the capacity to actually consider all of these or give them the resources that would potentially consider all of these?Those are the tangible things. What information, then, have school boards been given on how to communicate or how to involve the mana whenua where the school is based? These are some of the tangible options that, for example, the Minister may have considered. So I'd be keen to hear from the Minister.Now, the Minister has also mentioned, in terms of ākonga Māori and some other things—and I think it's really important to highlight that kura kaupapa, kōhanga reo, kura reo, and all of those sort of things, we are seeing tamariki Māori, etc., thriving in those environments. I don't deny the fact that the Minister has put resources into it. However, 97 percent of ākonga Māori are in English medium; they're not in Māori medium. So while we're celebrating Māori-medium success, what are we doing, signalling to those 97 percent of ākonga Māori in the English medium, saying \"We are now removing the school boards' need to give effect to Te Tiriti.\"? What, then, would the Minister say to these 97 percent?I really want to pick up the question from my colleague Cushla Tangaere-Manuel, because, I think, that question is really important, because what we are hearing from the Minister is that, yes, parents, caregivers, students can request it, but what that translates to is: if you want to do anything that is culturally yours, you've got to bat for it—you've got to ask for it; it is not naturally given to you as your birthright.Ingrid Leary: Madam Chair?Dr LAWRENCE XU-NAN: Sorry, Madam Chair? I'm almost done.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan.Dr LAWRENCE XU-NAN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I apologise. I lost track of time.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): I apologise too because I wasn't watching the clock; I was listening.Dr LAWRENCE XU-NAN: I think that's a really important point: what, then, would this signal to ākonga Māori in terms of how the Minister's intent is empowering them to succeed as Māori, not succeed for Māori? That is the really important question when we're looking at a lot of these.Again, I don't deny the fact that the Minister mentioned about success in phonics and all of those, because when you are looking for success, you will find success. But it's also ironic that the Minister uses phonics as an example, because I think it's a really important analogy when it comes to the understanding of phonics and semantics and all of those other things and when you're looking at context within a language, is that, with phonics, the Minister is using Māori like phonics, but the Minister doesn't understand the context of being Māori or what it means for Māori. That's a very, very important analogy when we're looking at purely singular success when it comes to phonetics.The Minister also mentioned te reo Māori being a taonga. Now, we have seen, both in terms of the way that the new curriculum has rolled out, we've also seen, in terms of some of the removal of kupu Māori in books like At the Marae. I want to check with the Minister, when she says that te reo Māori is a taonga, then why are kupu Māori being removed—Hon David Seymour: It's irrelevant to the bill.Dr LAWRENCE XU-NAN: Well, it is because that's what the Minister is saying, and the Minister is using this to justify that it's OK to remove giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.Jenny Marcroft: Is there a question?Dr LAWRENCE XU-NAN: The question, then, for the Minister is: why has, then, the ministry also decided not to include kupu Māori in any new Ready to Read Phonics Plus books, except for only in character names?So all of those sorts of things, I just wanted to get clarification from the Minister, because the Minister is saying one thing but what we are seeing in terms of the reality and what we are seeing in terms of the announcement is something that's completely different.Just to recap a couple of the questions that I have. The question is: why was there no child impact statement being made? What consultation has she done specifically with things like Mana Mokopuna, in terms of obligation to children, with Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti? What are the potential consequences of application to the Waitangi Tribunal? Has she considered any other options in terms of this particular bill, other than having one paramount objective? What is her position, then, on things like removing kupu Māori when she says that te reo Māori is a taonga?I want to finish with just touching on two additional things. One of the things is around NELP. I understand the Minister was saying, before, that one of the things that was part of the consultation was though NELP was really good, the current NELPs have \"particular regard\". That, I understand from what the Minister is saying. So I would ask the Minister to consider my amendment, Amendment Paper 403, which is to reinstate NELP but actually make it stronger by saying \"to give effect\" rather than just simply removing it altogether. I do agree with the Minister that \"have regards\" is a little bit more vague.I would also like to ask the Minister to consider my Amendment Paper 404. Now, this is one of the other questions I had earlier, which is: if nothing's going to change, why change section 127, everything within section 127, including supporting objectives? I want to pick up particularly on clause 8, new section 127(2) and 127(3). That we change \"To meet\" to \"In addition to\". Now, the reason for that is just to ensure that the supporting objective must be met. So it provides a clarity that has not been provided from a statutory interpretation perspective. So this particular amendment that I want to ask the Minister to consider is to provide a needed clarification that much more aligns the intention of the clause, where supporting objectives must be independently met, rather than have one be conditional on another.\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): I'll just run through those questions. Firstly, there's no requirement for a child impact statement. Secondly, the question around consultation—there was full ministerial consultation, as there always is in a Cabinet process, and Minister Potaka was also on Minister Goldsmith's ministerial advisory group around the Treaty principles work that was done, so he was consulted, of course.Around the claim that I've said nothing will change, that is not the case. What we've said is we want boards to be laser focused on raising achievement, and that's exactly what we expect to happen. But with the clarifications that we're putting into section 127, we are being very clear that there does still need to be—and very importantly—te reo, culture, and making sure that that equity gap is closed in section 127 so that boards are focused on doing their duty and not on a vague clause that says \"give effect to the Treaty\", but they don't know what that means. We are being clear in what it means: those are the things that you must do.The member is talking like there is only one objective for a school board. There are many objectives and they are all essential supporting objectives, but we want to make sure that they are laser focused on achievement.With the National Education and Learning Priorities (NELP), I appreciate the member's position, but this Government has come in with six very clear priorities. The NELP are overly burdensome. They are just one of many documents that school boards have to look at. We're reducing that compliance. We've been very clear on what we need them to do and been very clear on what our six key priority areas are, and that is the work of this Government. There may be some other things I haven't answered, apologies. There were lots of questions and I tried my very best.\n\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Thank you, Madam Chair. This is my first contribution, and I've been listening very carefully to what can seem like quite an academic and conceptual debate around \"giving effect to\" versus a list of things that are based on assumptions. Picking up on what the Minister of Education just said, we heard about te reo / language. We heard about culture versus \"giving effect to\", which was presented to us as being vague. I wanted to try and ground this in some questions, for the Hansard, actually—for the record—so that I'm reassured that not only our Māori kids but actually the diversity of cultures in New Zealand who benefit from Te Tiriti clauses will not be disadvantaged when it comes to things that do enhance their learning and do improve their academic achievement, and those are around culture and identity.I want to just reference work that I did with the Rt Hon Adrian Rurawhe a couple of years ago and bring the voices of the students into the House. I had a constituent case which was tricky, of a student who was wearing corn braids. That was part of his cultural identity. He was not Māori. The rector at the school decided that that was a distraction, and there was a bit of an impasse.The result of that was that we decided to hear the voices of students. We asked students from different schools—uniformed schools and non-uniformed schools; about six of them, I think, in total, from the greater Wellington region—to come in and give us their experience of having these school uniforms that did not or did require certain things. And this is around identity and culture. It was very clear, from those conversations—there were arguments on both sides, but it was very clear that cultural identity and giving effect to Te Tiriti is embedded in school uniform protocols and in grooming protocols, and that those protocols benefit not only Māori but other students. Actually, it goes a step further, because we also had a gender lens and we were able to understand the difficulty for some people to go into classrooms being required to wear binary uniforms that were distracting to their education. It was very clear that the evidence that the kids were giving us was that what they need to do to achieve is to feel comfortable and confident in their identity and in the rules that allow them to express themselves. As a result of that, the Human Rights Commission drew up a list of guidelines for boards of trustees, and those were received around Aotearoa. They were not mandatory, but they were based on the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, on freedom of expression and identity, and on Te Tiriti and giving effect to Te Tiriti. My question for the Minister now is, if we're going to take that out of the board of trustees' suite of things to consider, does that mean that those school uniform protocols that have been adopted by many schools and welcomed with open arms by many boards of trustees and by many students and that no doubt have led to higher achievement are to be thrown out—the baby with the bathwater? Does it mean that giving effect to Te Tiriti, as I understand what she just talked about, is about culture? So we might think of kapa haka performances, te reo classes, and resourcing. What about these really fundamental questions about self-expression and identity? Because if they are to be in that list of things, I think the Hansard needs to reflect that now so it's very clear. If they are not, if they're seen as a distraction and not part of the core things that boards are to focus on, then I think that needs to be on the record.That, again, goes back to whose perspective on identity and culture we are honouring here. Is it one part of the Treaty partnership or is it true partnership? The reason I ask this is because this is not conceptual. We have had feedback from students, even in my electorate, who have had cultural taonga through moko kauwae, through other things, where they have embraced those. Their schools have embraced them. They have found a new love of learning. They have said how liberating it is for their education, and all the evidence stacks that up. So this is not a conceptual debate, this is real life, and if the Minister agrees that those school uniform guidelines should stand, then I would like that to be on the Hansard so there is absolutely no doubt that we are not ripping away things that have been built carefully with students at the centre of the of the debate.\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): I've already said this a number of times and I'm in danger of repeating myself, but if the member looks at the Amendment Paper, firstly, it does say, \"takes [all] reasonable steps to ensure the policies and practices [at] the school reflect New Zealand's cultural diversity:\", and I expect that schools, as self-managing entities, will continue to do exactly that.There are a number of things in section 127 that are not changing: that a school is a physically and emotionally safe place for its students; that it gives effect to relevant student rights set out in this Act and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990; and that it takes all reasonable steps to eliminate racism, stigma, bullying, and other forms of discrimination within the school. There are a number of things that are already in the Act that protect against those things; it wasn't suddenly in just the last few years since the previous Labour Government put in the obligation for a board of trustees to give effect to the Treaty that suddenly gave rise to all of these things. In fact, the Opposition are speaking like this is a duty that has been on school boards since the dawn of time of boards, which is 1989. In fact, it's only been in since 2020 and it hasn't given rise to these things. In fact, since it's been in place, the core tenet, as I've said, of giving effect to the Treaty, which is raising student achievement, has gone backwards.I can assure that member that schools are self-managing entities, and they will still take these decisions and continue to do so because it is here and we're being very clear in the legislation: take reasonable steps to ensure that the policies and practices of its school reflect New Zealand's cultural diversity. I'm answering all of that member's questions.\n\nGRANT McCALLUM (National—Northland): I move, That debate on this question now close.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): The question is that debate on this question now close.

We will return at 7.30 and begin Part 2. Thank you.Sitting suspended from 6.16 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.\n\nPart 2 Amendments to other legislationCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Members, the committee is resumed on the Education and Training Amendment Bill (No 2). When we rose for the dinner break, we had just finished voting on Part 1. We now come to Part 2, which is the debate on clauses 29A to 30, \"Amendments to other legislation\", and Schedule 2. The question is that Part 2 stand part.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Point of order. Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to raise the fact that this is the earliest time we were able to raise a point of order after voting. When we were voting on the bill, before we were seeking to the chair that there are still substantial sections in Part 1 that weren't covered. We had both the responsible Ministers diligently sitting in their chairs waiting for their chance to speak on their part on attendance, universities—also noting for the chair that the Minister has dropped a significant amendment yesterday on the Teaching Council that we haven't had the chance to address as well. This obviously has significant public interest and the public was not consulted. So I want to seek your advice as the chair on when it's been voted, whether we can still have the opportunity in this section to seek some clarifications and questions for the Minister regarding the relevant parts.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Yes, so it's not the chair's role to direct the questioning. Members have the ability to direct questions to the relevant Ministers in the room. However, if you are able to address your concerns or your questions in Part 2 or the \"Title\" and \"Commencement\" stages, then that's fine as well. SHANAN HALBERT (Labour): Speaking to the point of order, Madam Chair. An example of that is we had agreed to discuss the freedom of expression component relating to universities in New Zealand in this legislation. It does sit in Part 1. We had an understanding from the chair and from the Minister to be able to speak to Minister Reti as the responsible Minister in that part. We weren't given a signal by the chair at the time to be able to shift into that debate. It is quite a large component on that, and I'm just seeking your guidance and would appreciate consideration to be able to discuss that as part of \"Title\".Hon David Seymour: Point of order. CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Just a minute. As I've explained to Lawrence Xu-Nan, it's not the chair's role to direct how members wish to question the Minister or the other Ministers who are in the room. So after two hours—I think—if there hadn't been a question based on those topics, then I think the opportunity is lost. But as I have said, if you can broaden your questions into Part 2 and \"Title\" and \"Commencement\", that is another opportunity where it could be addressed.Hon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Education): Speaking to the point of order, if I may. Madam Chair, I just note that the chair before the dinner break chose to accept a closure motion in full knowledge of where members had directed their questions, so now to dispute that chair's ruling is actually disorderly in itself.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): My rationale is to be helpful to members.Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: Madam Chair?CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): So you are seeking the call now? I call Lawrence Xu-Nan.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I do want to draw the Minister of Education's attention specifically to some of the questions I have around clause 29A, \"Principal regulations\".When we're looking at Part 2, the main element of this part is to amend the Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations, and also in terms of what we see in Schedule 2, as well, which is also part of Part 2. One of the key aspects of the school planning and reporting regulations, and one of the things we see here in terms of the preparation of the first and subsequent strategic plan—a key component of that is actually when we're looking at its association and the reason it's also been delayed, as well, in relevance to the attendance management plan. So I actually do want to ask the Minister some questions on the school planning and reporting plan and how it's going to relate to the attendance management plan.Now, on the attendance management plan, I know that we have voted on some of the earlier clauses, so I won't dwell on my amendment or even the vote, but I do want to check with the Minister that both in terms of something like the attendance management plan but also school planning and reporting regulations, on whether there is going to be a broader scope of—I guess a scope that broadens to some of the social impact that's related to how a school can plan and report on things like truancy and on things like school attendance. The reason I ask this question to the Minister is because we have seen significant investment this year in truancy, which is an important element of any school's planning and reporting, but, more importantly, as I'm travelling around the country and talking to different schools, I realise that a school's ability to plan and report is a lot more complex than simply just to say that students need to attend school.So, I guess, through this particular part, has the Minister, then, considered, as a requirement for the schools' planning and reporting, and in conjunction with an attendance management plan, how a school is meant to be given additional resources? They have already identified issues, but giving additional resources that genuinely address things around school attendance, such as the fact that we have one of the highest rates in the OECD—I know the Minister likes OECD data—for school bullying. We're seeing in the latest report by Asian Family Services, we're seeing 46.3 percent of the parents report that their child has been bullied at school. We know that bullying is a major driver of truancy. We also hear from communities, and particularly rural communities, that the cancellation of school bus routes has been a significant factor when it comes to school attendance and issues with school attendance and students being able to attend.So tying into clause 29A, I want to ask the Minister, while a school is looking at planning and reporting and attendance, how are they going to address some of these broader societal issues or broader issues that are within the realm of a departmental expenditure by the ministry, as opposed to a school's own ability to make certain changes?\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Part 2, the consequential amendment, is very narrow. It is around extending the date—January 1, 2026 to January 1, 2027—for school boards to prepare and deliver their strategic plan. So I'll answer questions around that.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): While I appreciate what the Minister of Education's saying in terms of the dates, the Minister will certainly be aware that anything you put on the table—we can actually ask that. Considering that we are looking at amendments—and we have seen multiple instances, including the fact that, under clause 3, we're able to discuss maybe more broadly some of the purpose and principles around the Education and Training Act 2020—it is not beyond the scope of a committee stage for us to also ask questions around the Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations in general.My question, again, to the Minister is while we're looking at the regulations in the context of education, school planning and reporting, what is the Minister's idea of how a school is able to plan and report with the kind of changes that we are seeing currently—which then involves attendance, which then does involve things like curriculum, which does involve things like changes to the way that teachers are able to have the kind of autonomy to be able to fully participate and have the kind of autonomy to do the work and schools have the autonomy to do the work that they do.Because, again, drawing on the Minister's own release on the amendment that is being dropped in this amendment bill around the Teaching Council; but just drawing on the example that the Minister has used evidence from Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), the OECD report 2024, as a rationale for some of these. But we are also seeing, within that same TALIS report 2024, that it talks about the fact that schools and teachers are really struggling with the lack of decision-making authority that they have. Again, when we are looking at school planning and reporting, I ask the Minister: how is she going to ensure that schools are able to plan and report when all of these changes are happening?Now, the reason I also mention that is I want to draw attention to the Minister and ask the Minister to consider my amendment for clause 29B in terms of the date, because the Minister—you're right, it does already replace the date from 1 January 2026 to 1 January 2027. But in my amendment, I make the argument that with the kind of changes that we're seeing—and particularly with some of the changes that we're seeing in, let's say, NCEA, which isn't coming into effect until much later—a prudent way of asking schools to be able to have that ability to prepare for the first and subsequent strategic plans, which is 29B, is to delay it by a further year. So I do ask, in combination with the questions I asked before, that the Minister consider my amendment that moves the date from 1 January 2027 to 1 January 2028.\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Almost everything that the member mentioned is completely out of scope, and I'm not going to address it for that reason. In answer to his second part, which is in scope, his amendment to change the time, I would note that this change from 1 January 2026 to 1 January 2027 was something that the select committee themselves had put forward and was accepted by the select committee. We agree with it and we're not going to change it any further.\n\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. If I can just help the Minister and take her to clause 30—we're in Part 2, clause 30. Clause 30 is talking about consequential amendments to secondary legislation, and in there it is amending secondary legislation as specified in Schedule 2, as set out in that schedule. If we then go to Schedule 2, it's consequential amendments to secondary legislation. In there, in particular, I want to talk about the Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations 2023. This is in scope, for the Minister's benefit.My questions are around the change with \"replace regulation 71F with the following\", which is F—that's the board strategies for giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, \"including strategies for: (1) achieving equitable outcomes for Māori students; (2) working to ensure it's plans, policies, and\"—and then the word's crossed out, \"local curriculum\", and it's replaced with \"teaching and learning programmes reflect local tikanga Māori, mātauranga Māori, and te ao Māori; and (3) taking all reasonable steps to make instruction available in tikanga Māori and te reo Māori\".My questions for the Minister are around these consequential amendments that are being made to the Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations, and in particular to talk about the removal of the term \"local curriculum\" and the replacing it with \"teaching and learning programmes\". This is a significant change, because teaching and learning programmes are the how of the curriculum, not the what of the curriculum. I think this significant change—it's important that the House, it's important that the public listening tonight are aware that this Government is wanting to remove from boards that responsibility around local curriculum.Why would they want to do that? What else have we seen recently with the release of the refreshed/rewritten curriculum: the minimising of local Aotearoa histories in our school. Local curriculum is a broader concept that refers to the entirety of what a school does, inclusive of teaching and learning programmes, enabling school boards to match learners' needs within the community and to the national curriculum. Reference to the local curriculum empowers teachers to implement the national curriculum in the context that is specific and relevant to the children in their school, and this promotes educational achievement.The process of developing local curriculum is one of the main ways that schools and kura have to build relationships and connections with whānau, with parents, with hapū, iwi, mana whenua, and communities.When the Minister spoke earlier about the board having no obligations now to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, to give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, she talked about the Crown's duty in terms of Article 3 of the Treaty, but she didn't talk about any of the Crown's responsibilities in terms of Article 1 and Article 2. In Article 1, we have partnership; in Article 2, we have rangatiratanga. I want to know how the Minister, in this clause 30, in Part 2, where we are now amending the secondary legislation based on what was voted on earlier, where we have the removing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi as well as the replacing of local curriculum—can the Minister please explain to us why she thinks that is appropriate, how this is not minimising that Treaty relationship, that importance of local curriculum, and the national curriculum in its local context? Can the Minister please—because I believe it is in scope—address those?\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): To be helpful to that member, that particular part in Schedule 2 that she is talking about has been replaced, so all of the things she was talking about have been replaced by Schedule 2 in my Amendment Paper that we already voted on. In terms of Schedule 2, the only parts we are now debating are the first parts: the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 and the Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations 2023. But where it says \"Replace regulation 7(1)(f) with:\", that was replaced with Schedule 2 in the Amendment Paper. We've already voted on it, so that is out of scope.\n\nCARL BATES (National—Whanganui): I move, That debate on this question now close.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Not quite yet. The Hon Willow-Jean Prime—but I do just want to alert members that we've had only three speeches to the Minister of Education, but we want to keep it very tight on this Part 2, and especially the schedules. Thank you.\n\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): That's right, Madam Chair, and I did keep it very tight to clause 30, and I was asking about those consequential amendments to secondary legislation, which the Minister is trying to tell me that that is out of scope. So I am seeking your guidance, Madam Chair: is the Minister correct that that is out of scope? Because I asked a serious—CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Did I say that was out of scope?Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME:  No, you didn't, did you? Oh, so the Minister—[Inaudible]. Thank you. Well, then—Hon Erica Stanford: Point of order. I'm sorry, the member just said that the Minister lied—Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: No, I didn't. I said you were wrong.Hon Erica Stanford: I heard you say that the Minister lied, and that is not appropriate for this House.Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: No, I said she was wrong.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): I'm sorry, I didn't hear it. If that's the case, I was obviously distracted.Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: Review it.Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: No, review it. I don't believe I said she lied. What I said was, I think she is wrong to say that this is out of scope, and I was seeking your direction, and you said you didn't say that, she did—CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): We can check. It'll just take a few minutes to get it. [Consults with Clerk] Yeah, we can't check it immediately, so we'll have to come back to it. Willow-Jean Prime.Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: Thank you, Madam Chair. Given that you did not say that these are out of scope, I would like the Minister to answer my questions that I asked in terms of the consequential amendments to Schedule 2, which is the \"Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations 2023\" and, in particular, my questions around the \"local curriculum\". What does that actually mean in terms of these regulations? Can you please explain all of that in terms of \"local curriculum\" and the points that I made, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and—I'll add a couple to that, Madam Chair: did you consult with those schools—CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): I didn't.Hon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME: The Minister—and those boards, and the whānau, hapū, iwi, mana whenua—your Treaty partners—on these changes that you're making to these regulations?\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): Once again, for the member, the bit that she is talking about is being replaced. So she keeps mentioning the words \"local curriculum\"; I just draw to her attention that that part in Schedule 2 has been replaced by my Amendment Paper 428, so she should look at the Amendment Paper for the correct part. This is just a consequential amendment. We've already covered this in Part 1. All this does is take that and put it into the regulations as a consequential amendment. That's important to democracy, to make sure that our regulations and our legislation are the same.Now, the member asked many, many, many questions and took the entire two hours to talk about this part. We've covered it at length and this is a consequential amendment, but I would like to draw her attention to the correct one that she should read from, which is in the Amendment Paper, which we have already voted on. It is no longer in scope.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I think one of the things that we were querying earlier was the fact that the Minister of Education mentioned that we have already voted on that. I think in terms of the voting part, this part on Schedule 2 will not be voted on until we conclude Schedule 2. So within the Schedule 2 from Amendment Paper 428 that the Minister is talking about, I do want to acknowledge the Minister for saying that it substantially changes what we're seeing in Schedule 2 of the amendment bill.But it then also means that we should again examine this new Schedule 2 as a completely new thing that has not had the scrutiny of the Education and Workforce Committee. I think it is important for us to spend a little bit of time just to unpack the difference between why there has been such significant change between what is in the original Schedule 2 and what is in the amendment that the Minister released yesterday.Now, in terms of replacement regulation 7(1)(f)(i), \"seeking to achieve\", that stays the same. We already covered the part about giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. I understand that that discussion has now drawn to a close. But I do want to check, and this is where my colleague the Hon Willow-Jean Prime is correct—when we say that what used to be in Schedule 2, in the select committee we changed \"local curriculum\" to \"teaching and learning programmes\". In replacement regulation 7(1)(f)(ii) of the Minister's amendment, that has changed completely. More importantly, the references to local tikanga Māori and mātauranga Māori are now gone. That is significant in light of the fact that we are also removing the part on giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. So my first question to the Minister is: does Minister think that Te Tiriti o Waitangi or anything around that is only limited to te reo Māori? What was the Minister's rationale, then, to remove local tikanga Māori and mātauranga Māori from this particular section? I'm going to leave that as this first question because I think this is quite a significant change from what is in the bill. Again, we are only able to debate on this for the first time today without any public consultation. CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): I'm just going to repeat: this particular part of the bill was debated at length in earlier debates. The amendment has been voted on. What we are debating now are the consequential amendments to secondary legislation. We are not re-debating the issues that have been raised.Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: Madam Chair.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Just a minute.Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: Point of order. But Schedule 2 is within scope of Part 2, though, because it is under clause 30, which is Part 2.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): I think the member is starting to challenge my ruling. I just want to be clear, the amendments are to secondary legislation. It is not an opportunity to re-debate things that have already been voted on earlier today.\n\nCARL BATES (National—Whanganui): I move, That debate on this question now close.\n\nA party vote was called for on the question, That debate on this question now close.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 49New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15.Motion agreed to.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendment to Part 2 set out on Amendment Paper 422 be agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendment be agreed to.Ayes 49New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15.Noes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Amendment not agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That Part 2 be agreed to.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 49New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15.Part 2 agreed to.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that the Minister's amendment to Schedule 1 set out on Amendment Paper 364 be agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendment be agreed to.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 49New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15.Amendment agreed to.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendment to Schedule 1 set out on Amendment Paper 424 be agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That amendment be agreed to.Ayes 49New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15.Noes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Amendment not agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That Schedule 1 as amended be agreed to.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Schedule 1 as amended agreed to.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that the Minister's amendments to Schedule 2 set out on Amendment Papers 364 and 428 be agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendments be agreed to.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Amendments agreed to.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendments to Schedule 2 set out on Amendment Paper 403 are out of order as being inconsistent with a previous decision of the committee.Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendment to Schedule 2 set out on Amendment Paper 415 is out of order as being inconsistent with a previous decision of the committee.A party vote was called for on the question, That Schedule 2 as amended be agreed to.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Schedule 2 as amended agreed to.\n\nClauses 1 to 3CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Members, we come now to our final debate. This is the debate on clauses 1 to 3: \"Title\", \"Commencement\", and \"Principal Act\".\n\nFRANCISCO HERNANDEZ (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I rise to take a call on the question of commencement, and drawing on your guidance earlier, am attempting to link some parts of the first part that were not adequately discussed, but very much linking it to the commencement date as per your recommendation.Now, the commencement of this bill comes into force on the day after Royal assent and my questions are around whether this would apply to all parts of the bill, particularly clauses 11 and 12. These are the parts that confer additional responsibilities on the university councils, or does the Minister anticipate that there's like a transition period for the university councils to adopt these statements on freedom of expression? Because if it is the day after the commencement, are they expected to have it, like, straight away, or is there more of a kind of gradual transition period whereby the university councils will have time to devise, consult, and create these statements on freedom of expression? I do ask that because I do think some universities have already developed statements on freedom of expression, so that's not a problem with the commencement date, but others have not yet.I guess, in terms of the interpretation on some of these things that we didn't get a chance to flesh out, what does the Minister anticipate in terms of the universities not being able to take public positions on matters? Does that mean that if a university was to take a stance on a public matter after the commencement date of this bill, they would get into trouble? Or if a submission has already been made to an existing legislation, but it was before the commencement date, does that mean that they won't get into trouble?I'm just curious on the interaction of the commencement date and the requirement of the university to adopt statements of freedom of expression and how it interacts with them not being able to take public positions on matters, particularly as relates to the commencement date.I think that it is really important to tease out what taking a public position on matters as institutions actually does refer to. Does it extend as far as curricula, for example?Hon David Seymour: Maybe, but we've debated that.FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ: Well, \"maybe\"—exactly. Well, I mean, that would be terrible. If a university were to equally have to teach that creationism was as valid as, you know, the scientific theories of evolution, I think all members would agree that was a bad thing. So, I think it's really important to clarify what that actual relationship with the commencement date is and whether that retroactively applies to existing curricula and existing things that—Hon David Seymour: Point of order. Madam Chair, these should have relevance. It's a very narrow question when the Act comes into force. I could help the member. If he looks at the relevant schedule, it's six months after the Act comes into force that the university must have a plan. The content of it has been debated in earlier parts. FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ: He's not the Minister, so—CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The member still has the call.FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ: Great, thank you. Oh well, I appreciate the Minister's contribution.Hon David Seymour: Well, sit down then.FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ: Well, I still have one minute left so—but I think that it is particularly important on what does apply with that six-month period commencement. Does that retroactively apply to existing curricula and existing past positions that the universities have already taken on statements? Are they required to retroactively pretend that they didn't have stances on certain issues to comply with this Government diktat, which, essentially, is forcing universities not to take positions on certain issues? Is there an element of retrospectivity with regard to that six-month commencement date that the honourable Minister very helpfully pointed out? Because, you know, I think it would be terrible if it were to retrospectively apply to existing past statements. Also, whether it applies to curricula as well, or whether it's just expected that public positions actually means statements or actual political positions, and it doesn't actually affect the teaching curricula of the university.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I also want to speak to the commencement date, clause 2—and I'm just signalling to the Chair, I won't take a full call because I would like to take a call later on the title. I want to check in terms of that, in conjunction with my Amendment Paper, Amendment Paper 402, which is to replace \"on the day after\" with \"six months after\". The reason I put this amendment together is mainly because of the fact that what we have seen, especially with the new amendment that has just come out this morning, it has caught school boards by surprise, is that there has been no indication that sufficient time has been given for school boards to be able to be compliant with the bill once the bill has been enacted. Unlike the section on universities, I haven't seen within this bill, anyway, and the Minister may like to speak to that, that allows school boards to be compliant with the new requirement—or at least shift towards the new requirement—once it has been enacted, if it's only the day after Royal assent. I think a six-month transition period is sensible for the schools to be able to do something like that, unless the Minister is suggesting that while the commencement date comes into force the day after Royal assent, school boards may not need to immediately be compliant or need to make the relevant changes that we see in this bill. So that's kind of one element.I think the other element that we haven't had a chance to discuss and I think is quite significant is to do with how the commencement date is going to work with the Minister's Amendment Paper 364, on the changing of the composition of the Teaching Council. Now, this has raised significant concerns since this amendment has come out, and I want to check with the Minister, because I'm assuming the Minister isn't going to respond on whether this is actually considered now that the membership is dominated more so by Minister-appointed members, as opposed to independently elected. The Minister may or may not wish to address the fact of what that meant for the independence of the Teaching Council, which is a huge concern.But, from a commencement date perspective, I want to check, once this bill comes into effect the day after Royal assent, at what point the Teaching Council will need to change its membership, noting that in section 486 of the Education and Training Act, the Teaching Council does have at least a mandate on how they are meant to do their nomination and process, but does it apply to the Minister-appointed members on that committee? I'm seeing a shaking of the head from officials.Now, if the Minister wouldn't mind just elucidating this committee on how that particular election process and transition from an independent majority Teaching Council to a Minister-appointed majority Teaching Council is going to work after the commencement of this bill.\n\nCAMILLA BELICH (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. This is my first opportunity to make a contribution in this bill—regretfully at the latter stages of the debate, focused quite narrowly on the three clauses that we have remaining in front of us, and so I wanted to make a couple of comments around a few of those.First of all, with the commencement. Now, this is not a bill that I have worked on at the Education and Workforce Committee at all. So when I was reading it today, I read the primary amendment piece of legislation, the Education and Training Amendment Bill (No 2), and I looked at it and tried to understand. I looked at the original piece of legislation that it's amending, which is the Education and Training Act, and tried to piece those two together. But, of course, as the House and the committee will be well aware, it's not possible to understand this particular Act by reading those two pieces of legislation and draft legislation because of the number of Amendment Papers that have been put forward.I think this is relevant to clause 2—\"Commencement\"—because of the late nature of the two Amendment Papers, and the primary ones that I'm looking at are 364 and 428, which I'm not looking to debate at this stage. But I think that because they raise such significant changes to the bill that perhaps the Minister of Education could consider later commencement dates for the changes contained within those Amendment Papers.For example, Amendment Paper 428, which looks to remove the Treaty clauses and instead replace that with other duties that could, for example—and I suggest this amendment to the Minister now—come in, say, \"one year after Royal assent\" as opposed to \"at Royal assent\", to give time for this to be socialised with the sector. Obviously, we haven't had a select committee stage; we haven't had the ability to hear submissions on this. We haven't had a particularly long committee stage, Madam Chair—that's not a criticism, that's just a reflection of the fact that committee stages are, by their nature, not perhaps the best way to scrutinise these. That would be a suggestion that I would make to clause 2 of the bill.Also, in addition to that, obviously Amendment Paper 364. I was checking with my colleagues, and they said that a number of these changes haven't been traversed in relation to the Teaching Council that extensively. These were quite surprising changes that I saw reported in the media; that there was going to be a significant change to the way that the teaching profession was going to be regulated. There is a question, I think, as to whether it is appropriate for those significant changes to come in without a select committee process, without the chance to socialise that, not only with the Teaching Council, those employed by the Teaching Council, those affected by the changes to the governance of the Teaching Council, those impacted in the wider education sector, the profession. I think that that would merit consideration of a later commencement date for those changes contained within Amendment Paper 364. I'd like the Minister, if possible, to comment on those.In terms of the title, obviously there are other kind of probably not very realistic titles that I could suggest and are often suggested at this stage. It's not my intention at this stage—although perhaps maybe some other members would like to suggest some title changes that may be more reflective of this bill.But actually, the fact that we've already had two Education and Training Amendment Acts this year, I think, warrants consideration of whether it should be changed to a title. Not a title which doesn't reflect the content of the bill, not a title which is a ridiculous suggestion, but something that actually reflects what this actually does. My suggestion to the Minister would be instead of the Education and Training Amendment Act (No 2) 2025, whether she would consider changing that to the \"Education (Removal of Teaching Council Provisions and Removal of Treaty Clauses) Amendment Bill\". Because that is what the bill actually does, and I wondered if the Minister would be able to seriously consider those suggestions around commencement and the appropriateness of the commencement of this—we've got such a short period of consultation—and also whether the title does, in fact, reflect the bill.\n\nHon ERICA STANFORD (Minister of Education): I'm not sure if the member Camilla Belich was here earlier when we were discussing the fact that we are giving schools a whole additional year to do their next strategic plan. The last bit we've just finished voting on moves that from 1 January next year to 1 January 2027, and so there is plenty of time for schools to look at the new section 127 and the new regulations, and then put them into their strategic plans. We've already discussed that.In terms of the Teaching Council, it is a very minor change. It's just an additional person and we will make that change immediately, and so there's no reason for us to do that.The member also suggested a change saying that, essentially, the bill is only about two things. The bill is a lot more than that. Unfortunately, members in this committee stage didn't ask any questions on any other part of the bill. That's why we didn't get to talk about it, and so it's really unfortunate. But there are a lot more things in the bill, and so I think that the bill's title should stay the same.\n\nHon WILLOW-JEAN PRIME (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. Just wanting to pick up on that point that the Minister of Education made. Just for absolute clarity for all of our schools and kura out there, are you saying that their current strategic plans which give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, which outline the things that I said earlier about the legislation, which have now been replaced with the strategies in your Amendment Paper—so for all of next year, their current strategic plans are the ones that they will be governing their schools in accordance with? Your changes are not required to come into effect until 2027, is that right? Could you just clarify for all those schools in their planning?Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan: Madam Chair.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): I'm going to call Lawrence Xu-Nan, but I can't hear a much more new material coming in.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for this opportunity, because I do want to address the title of this bill because I have a number of amendments to the title. But I want to, first, thank the Minister of Education for responding to my questions. That's very helpful. So thank you, Minister.In terms of the title of the bill, we've heard previously from my colleague Camilla Belich that the title should reflect the bill, and this is the second education and training bill, not including the early childhood education reform bill that's coming up as well. But I think to capture everything, like the Minister suggested, my tabled amendment is to call it the \"Education and Training (Broad Objectives, Attendance, Teaching Councils, and Other Matters) Amendment Bill\", which does, in fact, capture everything and is inclusive of that.But looking at the title, summing up what we have discussed in the committee stage today, there are things that I think are better reflected within the title, because one of the things that we have heard consistently is the fact that we are removing the giving effect to Te Tiriti in section 127 of the Act. We are removing, even in some of the supporting objectives, the idea of local tikanga Māori and mātauranga Māori. We are looking at the fact that te reo Māori for ākonga Māori in mainstream is only available should they ask for it, as opposed to the default.So I think I would like the Minister to seriously consider my amendment, which is to call the bill the \"Education and Training (Recolonising Education) Amendment Bill\", because that's kind of what we're seeing here in terms of the amount of things that have been removed as part of this bill. It's really important when we do look at education, Minister, that we are looking at education that is appropriate in the context of the students and in the context of those who are learning and who are being educated in our system, because if they cannot find relevance in there, it is much harder for them to get the educational outcome that the Minister has mentioned throughout this committee stage.So, in many ways, this is very similar to what we're seeing when we first start to learn about things like phonics, which the Minister has mentioned throughout this debate. When we're learning about our A, Bs, and Cs, we're learning that \"A is for Antelope, L is for Llama\", and those are kind of the things that, for some students, they may never see in their entire life. So how are students able to relate to that, how are students able to learn best from that if they cannot find the relevance? So my amendment that I would like the Minister to consider is changing the title to the \"Education and Training (Antelopes and Llamas) Amendment Bill\".Finally, I would like the Minister to consider the fact that when we're looking at the packaging of the changes to section 127 with the removal of giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, we are looking at the changes that we are making to the Teaching Council. We are looking at the fact that we're introducing a redundant piece of legislation on freedom of expression, as many universities already have a policy on that. A better title of this bill is the \"Education and Training (Atlas's Puppet) Amendment Bill\".\n\nCARL BATES (National—Whanganui): I move, That debate on this question now close.\n\nA party vote was called for on the question, That debate on this question now close.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Motion agreed to.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendment to clause 1 to insert \"(Board Objectives, Attendance, Teaching Council and Other Matters)\" be agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendment be agreed to.Ayes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Noes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Amendment not agreed to.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's remaining amendments to clause 1 are out of order as not being an objective description of the bill.The Hon Willow-Jean Prime's 14 tabled amendments to clause 1 are out of order as not being an objective description of the bill.A party vote was called for on the question, That clause 1 be agreed to.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Clause 1 agreed to.CHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): The question is that Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan's amendment to clause 2 set out on Amendment Paper 402 be agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendment be agreed to.Ayes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Noes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Amendment not agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That clause 2 be agreed to.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Clause 2 agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That clause 3 be agreed to.Ayes 68New Zealand National 49; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 55New Zealand Labour 34; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Clause 3 agreed to.Bill to be reported with amendment.\n\nMEDICINES AMENDMENT BILLIn CommitteePart 1  Consent to distribute medicines by verificationCHAIRPERSON (Maureen Pugh): Members, we come now to the Medicines Amendment Bill.

The question is that Part 1 stand part.\n\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. It's nice to see this bill enter the committee stage and to see it come through with many improvements made by the Health Committee. We're always grateful for the opportunity to be able to participate in panel beating the bill at select committee.I'd like to ask the Minister some questions tonight. The first one, I'd like to link to the original policy intent of the bill. Clause 4, the \"consent by verification\", which is the main innovation in this bill: I'd like to hear from the Minister why this consent by verification and the verification pathway applies to new medicines, and what is meant by a \"new\" medicine. What about other already approved medicines that might have a minor change, like a change in their presentation, or a minor change in their formulation that doesn't require a full evidence review? Why is that not part of the verification pathway, given that, on the surface, you'd think those would be lower-risk types of changes and, perhaps, more frequent than the need to actually verify new medicines?I would appreciate it if the Minister could expand on why this consent by verification pathway only applies to new medicines.\n\nHon PEENI HENARE (Labour): Tēnā koe, Madam Chair, and thank you very much. It's one of those bills where specifics matter, and I'm curious—and if the Minister wouldn't mind answering some of the questions I have—around the recognised regulatory authorities. That's in clause 7. It goes on to talk about, as a regulator of medicine—and it lists those that it has in there. I wonder if that might include, to the Minister's reckoning, or at least to the Minister's consideration, some of the work that the important ethics committees and others might do in that space, with respect to the medicines. If the Minister wouldn't mind giving some thought to whether or not they perhaps could be included, either now or at a later date, with respect to making sure that we have recognised regulatory authorities.The other matter I wanted to raise is, in clause 6, the following particulars are required, and it goes down to the letter \"(m) the name and address of the place or places where the manufacture, preparation, or packing is intended to be carried out.\" The reason I ask that question is that a number of concerned members of the public who have travelled widely around the world know that, in some countries, they repackage goods, even give them different names, but in effect they are still the same thing. Yet they want to be sure that, when these types of matters are raised and medicines are brought into this country, the origin of those particular medicines, of both its manufacture and of course its preparation and packaging, is clear and is well understood for those in New Zealand. At the moment, those regulations are pretty tight. What we're concerned about is any loosening of those matters could cause some confusion about the types of medicines that those people might be gaining access to. Some clarification from the Minister on those particular matters will be helpful.\n\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): Thank you, Madam Chair. My colleague has picked up on clause 6, so another question in relation to clause 6, which lists the contents of an application under the verification pathway. I'd like the Associate Minister of Health David Seymour to explain how these requirements interact with the common documentation system used by some of the regulators we are likely to recognise. There's a number of specifics here that all seem very logical from the perspective of approving a particular medicine, but we've been told repeatedly at the Health Committee that there's the potential for great efficiency through the use of standardised documentation when these applications are made—or applications for the Minister's consent, as it's called in this bill. So we'd like to understand how requirements (a) through to (m) interact with the standardised documentation system.\n\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd just like to support the vote of confidence in this bill from my colleague the Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall, who really gave it some good scrutiny at the Health Committee. I think it's important to note that, in the broader constitutional policy space, there is quite a shift of power from legal, prescriptive sorts of requirements through to empowering Ministers to act through notices and rules, and I do think that raises a number of legal questions. While I accept that it improves the agility of being able to get medicines out faster, there are questions around parliamentary scrutiny, and there are questions about the transparency of Gazette notices, and also how section 22 in particular interacts legally with new section 22A.I'll just go through them in turn, and I'm happy to either have a longer contribution or do some quick-fire. We do recognise that delegation and flexibility are important, because medicines are the new frontier for being able to get people well faster, and potentially save a lot of money around more invasive procedures, like operations. We do accept that there are efficiency gains, in that there will be a reduction of duplication of effort, consistent with our trade and health cooperation frameworks with Australia. I think where the rubber hits the road, though, is around the dependence on secondary legislation, and there are operational details, such as time lines, data requirements, verification procedures, that will only exist in future rules, not in primary legislation. That produces a kind of layered legal dependency, where the rights and obligations of applicants hinge on rules that are not yet drafted.That's tricky; I'd be keen to hear the Minister's views on how he sees that interplay and the certainty that will be afforded, particularly if applicants are going to be questioning some of the applicant decisions—how those sections 22 and 22A will interplay, because, once again, we find ourselves in the House where we are subordinating to secondary legislation quite a bit of the devil in the detail. That will be important, we want to support that, but we need to know that there will be due diligence given to ensure that there isn't uncertainty for those who apply, because that could have a chilling effect on the market, and that the rules are really clear from the outset, even though we have this kind of parallel stream of how the Medicines Act is going to work.I will have more questions later about regulatory capture and the medicines regulations and some of the constitutional implications, but I'd just like the Minister to answer those if he may.\n\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): I'd like to thank members for their questions so far, and I'll try and address each of them in turn. Ayesha Verrall asked about clause 4 and specifically the words \"new medicine\": why would a new indication, or perhaps a minor change, to a medicine not be able to access this verification pathway, which the words \"new medicine\" might suggest that it couldn't? I'm advised that, in actual fact, a new medicine, a new use—i.e., a major change to a medicine—would be captured as a \"new medicine\" for the purpose of this bill, whereas a minor change would be already notified. So, in other words, if a change is significant enough to require consent, then it is a new medicine, even though there might be something very much like it already consented.Peeni Henare asked two questions, one about clause 7, and he asked a question about whether an ethics committee could also be involved in authorising a medication. I don't intend it to go any further than the bill right now. He asked if we might in the future—that's certainly quite possible. But the point here is to rely on trusted nations' consent authorities—and those trusted nations are set out in secondary legislation—rather than introduce any new pathways through other bodies, besides what I've just described.He also asked about replacement section 21(2)(m)—for motel—inserted by clause 6: the name of the place and why is this necessary. He pointed out that one of the dangers with medication is that what it says on the label might not be what's there. A lot of Medsafe's work is ensuring that what you read on the label is actually what's in there, and it's certainly true that some medicines are manufactured and packaged in parts of the world that might not have the same sort of ethics and standards that we're used to in New Zealand. So that's why it's actually important that they identify where will this be packaged and manufactured, so that we do have oversight—or Medsafe can have oversight, rather—not only of what does it say it is, but what actually is it.Ayesha Verrall then asked about clause 6, inserting replacement section 21(2), and how these requests interact with the common document system used by other countries. In other words, are the requirements listed in paragraphs (a) to (m) of section (21)(2) going to mesh well with the common technical dossier—I think that was the point of the question. I'm advised that, yes, it will. The company needs to provide the full data dossier, which is standardised internationally, and that has been thought of.Finally, Ingrid Leary asked about what she says is a shift of power towards Ministers. It's certainly true that it talks about a Minister granting consent. That, at a constitutional, technical level, may be true, but, ultimately, this decision making is not done by a Minister; it's done in their name. It's done by people with far more appropriate qualifications in pharmacology—than most people who have held the role of Minister—in this legislation.In terms of the question about accountability and stability—and I was pleased to hear about, you know: how do we make sure that there's certainty for people who are applicants? I just make the point that any rules, made under this law, that will set out how it operates do need to be presented to the House and are subject to disallowance by Parliament. So, under our normal conventions, we maintain parliamentary oversight, and there'll also be consultation with affected people prior to making any of these rules. So I hope that addresses the questions that have been asked so far.\n\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): Thank you to the Associate Minister of Health for his answers. I'd like to talk about new section 22AA in clause 7. The Health Committee's view was that it was a helpful change to the bill to, rather than specify the regulators in primary legislation, specify criteria about which overseas regulators would be able to be recognised. We think that that's a positive, helpful change, and we're pleased to see it reflected in the bill now. I want to draw the Minister's attention to the revocation of recognition of an authority. I would like the Minister to expand on what type of circumstances he imagines an authority's recognition might be revoked, and any elaboration he can provide based on advice he's received on that.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. I just have two quick questions for the Minister regarding clause 6, inserting new section 21(2).The first question I have—and this is partly because one of my degrees is actually in pharmacology—is on subsection (2)(h), \"reports of toxicological, pharmacological, and clinical studies that support the application:\". I want to check with the Minister whether there is a requirement for that particular study to be conducted or to be peer reviewed as well. The reason I mention that is because there have been instance where, particularly in the chase for funding for toxicological or pharmacological studies, peer review hasn't been done as much or as well. That is something I want to check with the Minister: whether there is a requirement.The second thing is around subsection (2)(k), in terms of the distribution in any country other than New Zealand, and also, this plays into \"approved or consented to by the appropriate authorities in that country\" but also potentially recognises the regulatory authority that has been touched on previously in clause 7, which inserts new section 22AA. My question is whether there have been any safeguards considered by the Minister on what happens in the event that, or how do we potentially vet if, a particular appropriate authority or authority in that country has been susceptible to undue industrial or political pressure. Those are my two initial questions.\n\nRICARDO MENÉNDEZ MARCH (Green): Thank you, Madam Chair. So my question was in relationship to new section 22AA(1)(e), inserted by clause 7. This is in relationship to the recognised regulatory authorities. One of the requirements that's been set out in the legislation is for those to conduct their business and release reports in English. I wanted to ask whether the Minister for Regulation thinks that that may potentially hinder the ability for us to access medicines where the business may be conducted in another language.The reason why I ask this as well is because we do have, in replacement section 21(2)(j), inserted by clause 6, that, for example, translations may be provided when it comes to the applications for the Minister's consent. So in clause 6, there's this acknowledgment that translations can play a part in enabling good decision-making, but then in new section 22AA, there is the sort of much more tight requirement for the business of these entities to be conducted in English without, I guess, being able to accommodate, for example, resources to translate necessary documents to English in order to be able to broaden the range of recognised regulatory bodies that the Government can tap into so that people can have greater access to medicines.So my question to the Minister is whether he thinks that new section 22AA(1)(e) unnecessarily narrows the recognised regulatory authorities, particularly in relationship to the way that clause 6 has been written. Thank you.\n\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd just like to ask a further supplementary question based on the question raised by the Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall regarding the revocation or designation of a recognised authority. Normally, ministerial decisions are not subject to explicit procedural safeguards. If it's in the Gazette and a decision has been made, normally there are notice and comment requirements beyond publication. So my first question to the Minister on that natural justice and transparency issue is: are there other forms of contesting decisions either with designation or revocation, except via judicial review, which we know is incredibly expensive and again could have a chilling effect on the market?I wouldn't mind turning also to—just for some clarity, I think really for the Hansard, because I did raise this previously—the relationship between section 22 and the amendment. If there is a question of which one supersedes, because there are two pathways, it would be good to know what is the primary section out of those? If there are two pathways, if there are inconsistent rules, which rules under those two pathways should supersede?I've got another question, too, just around the administrative burden, because with the gazetting of notices which are required—so they recognise or they revoke authorities—it could create some transitional uncertainty for applicants. Is there an efficient way of doing that or is that just going to be a constant stream of Gazette notices?The other one is: could legal challenges arise where a medicine has been approved under one recognition regime and then is later affected by revocation? Probably, again, the \"hierarchy\" is the word I was looking for in terms of which of the two streams that they can be approved under would take precedence.I think there is also another question that is similar but different to the one raised by the Green member around localised safety assessment. Where the Minister may revoke consents, the process relies on post market intervention rather than pre-market evaluation, and that can have inherent public risk if adverse effects arise later. What are the mitigations for that risk, particularly because that is a localised situation and those conditions may have changed within the New Zealand market, but may not necessarily have come up from an external market?That's probably all my questions, but they are important legal questions if we are to see this legislation actually reap the full financial and health benefits to New Zealand that it is touted to do.\n\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): I thank members for this latest batch of questions. I appreciate Ayesha Verrall saying that this is a positive change that the countries, or at least the regulators of the countries, that will be deemed equivalent or valid for the assurance pathway—that that is going to be set in secondary legislation, rather than hard-wired into this law. Then she asked a question about revocation. The test is whether the regulator continues to meet the criteria set out in paragraphs (a) to (e) of new section 22AA(1) in clause 7. If it starts failing to meet those, then it would be revoked, and so those are the criteria set out in the legislation. Lawrence Xu-Nan asked about the credibility of toxicological, pharmacological, and clinical studies. They're peer-reviewed by the regulator who has given consent overseas, and so I guess that the point is that if we've—these questions sort of go together. If the overseas regulator is approved, then one of the criteria for that is that we can trust that they rely on good science, and, of course, if they rely on good science, that probably answers Lawrence Xu-Nan's question. With regard to new section 21(2)(k) in clause 6, there was a question about proof that it's been consented elsewhere. It really is as simple as being able to demonstrate credibly that the consent overseas truly exists, and so it's a fairly mechanical, administrative thing. Ricardo Menéndez March raised an interesting question about: does limiting ourselves to English-speaking jurisdictions restrict the possible range of overseas agencies that we could rely on for verification? Potentially, but I think that members might be surprised. For example, I asked about Japan. I've been informed that the Japanese consenting authority actually conducts its business in English, and so that's a significant country with its own language that none the less uses English to work with the rest of the world. There may be countries that conduct their business in other languages, but there are certainly enough countries who do their medical consenting in English that I think that there's a big enough pool for this policy to work very well. Then Ingrid Leary asked a series of questions about the natural justice of revocation, and whether there could be peer review or other ways to challenge that. I think that it's important to recognise, simply, that in the part that she talked about, she's talking about whether or not—as I understand it—a particular country can be recognised for their consenting agency, rather than a particular applicant. It's true that a country might be offended that we no longer recognise them, but that in itself is, I don't think, a reason to have a major bootstraps, belt and braces approach to natural justice where New Zealand's Government will choose countries that it thinks it can rely on for this pathway. There was a question about a hierarchy between the usual consenting pathway and the new rule-of-two consenting pathway. For a starting answer—and I might need to get more advice about this, because she also asked what would happen if a medicine fails at one pathway but succeeds at another. I would start by saying that the purpose is that if you have consent through either of them, it must be adequate, but we certainly would not retrospectively revoke. Then there was a question of could there be a—actually, I've addressed the question of the legal challenge against revocation. There was, finally, a question about localised safety assessments, and are there problems where there might be local conditions where the population—if I understood her question correctly, the population in New Zealand has different needs or vulnerabilities from those in other countries. I would just make the point that most countries have quite diverse populations within their borders. By the time you've got two other countries that have consented a medication, I suspect that you'd find that, actually, they've covered enough bases so that it's safe in New Zealand, particularly considering that one of the criteria for considering if you want to keep doing business with someone is to ask whether they have robust systems. So I hope that addresses the questions asked today.\n\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): Thank you. I'd now like to ask the Minister some questions about the development of his policy thinking in this area. In particular, I have been studying the coalition agreement between the National and the ACT Party, which is referenced in the regulatory impact statement (RIS). The commitment that's relevant to this bill was to require Medsafe to approve new pharmaceuticals within 30 days of them being approved by at least two overseas regulatory agencies recognised by New Zealand. I read that and I interpret that as automatic approval, and yet, that's not what this bill does. This bill still requires a sponsor to make an application. So it is not the case that we'd have a very efficient system where just with approval in two jurisdictions, there will be a requirement for automatic approval. Instead, it requires a sponsor, usually the pharmaceutical company, and the application to be made.My first question to the Minister is why has the thinking, with respect to how this bill will operate, changed from what was envisaged in the coalition agreement and what's in the bill now? I'm interested to know how he thinks that change will impact the efficiency benefits that will come from this bill, because the purpose of the bill is to speed up the approvals of new medicines in New Zealand, and, of course, as a result of the change between what's envisaged in the coalition agreement and the bill that we have now, there will be fewer medicines being considered through this pathway. In particular, one of the things that comes into play—because of the way the bill we're debating is crafted—is the incentives that apply to a sponsor. Now, in the original version that wasn't relevant, but it is now, in the way that this bill is constructed. We heard at select committee that a number of incentives operate on sponsors, including that they make judgments on the likelihood of their bill achieving Pharmac funding in New Zealand. They'll think, \"Well, is it really worth our while to put something through a process when\"—perhaps, they would say—\"unlikely to get it funded.\" That makes me wonder, well, will this bill have the actual impacts that were promised when it was proposed? I'd like to hear the Minister's explanation of how impactful he thinks it will be in light of those changes.\n\nHon PEENI HENARE (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair. I'm going to speak to clause 7, 22B(4) and just ask for a bit of clarification, so this won't take very long: \"The Director-General may issue the applicant with 1 or more invoices for any fee payable under regulations in respect of the application.\" Is that only those that are successful? Does that include those that are declined? Is there an opportunity to see a schedule of what those fees may look like? Is there transparency around those particular invoices we can expect to be made public to allow us the confidence that there's consistency in their fees framework? So just some clarification around that. I know it seems relatively small in the scheme of things, but I just think that when we look towards the way that those who access the ability for consideration as medicines that it's made very clear what those fees do look like, and whether or not those include those that are accepted as well as the ones that are declined.\n\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): My colleagues have talked about the drivers, if you like, of efficiency with the system and how that will look compared to the original coalition agreement. I think, extrapolating on that, there is a real potential for a streamlined process to reduce scrutiny of pharmaceutical submissions if the decision making becomes overly reliant on the second stream. We don't have any control over that or influence over that. There are jurisdictions that we compare ourselves to that have far more lobbying and political influence in their system. Conceivably, there may be two or more jurisdictions with very big pharma companies—just as there are with tobacco companies, actually—where a concerted effort is made to promote things that may not necessarily be consistent with New Zealand public interest standards.If there is a two-tier system and they both function, that's probably not much of a problem, but if the second tier becomes the predominant way of getting pharmaceuticals through to New Zealand, I think it does raise real questions about the drivers and the safeguards. So I'm really just wanting some reassurance that the New Zealand public interest standards are met through whatever rules come out, which have not yet been written, and that we don't see a kind of tail wagging the dog, where the whole sector then becomes beholden to international commercial interests that don't necessarily serve New Zealand public interest standards.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you, Minister, for responding to my previous questions. I have two more questions for the Minister. The first one is something the Minister said, and it kind of ties into new section 22C(1)(b)(v) as well. I think the Minister was saying that in terms of some of the pharmacological or clinical studies that have been done in other countries, other countries also have a diverse population in order to be able to test some of that. Two authorities have approved that, and it should, again, be safe enough here. But I think one of the things I would be interested to know about—certain countries, most of the other countries, don't have the same data on the indigenous population of Aotearoa, and also, potentially, Pacific populations.So, you know, looking at new section 22C(1)(b)(v), when it talks about contextualising \"the benefit-risk profile of the medicine due to local disease epidemiology, public health considerations\", I do wonder, in those sorts of considerations: does the Minister consider that while we do have a diverse population, some of that interaction, particularly when we're looking at it from a pharmacological context, may not have been tested here? So I just want to check; the Minister may already have a response to that.The second part is around new section 22D, noting that there is a lot of ministerial authority in this bill, and we're looking at the rules for Minister's consent by verification. I wanted to check with the Minister: when we are looking at things that are done by Order in Council and when there is secondary legislation, did the Minister, as always, consider some sort of review clause in terms of how the Minister may make rules setting out some of that requirement, or is there something that will be done, in terms of a review of those rules, on a more ad hoc or need basis?In terms of the rules, as we are always concerned about, in terms of any potential overreach or potential \"Henry VIII\" clause, I think having something of a review clause would also be another level of safeguard that can be protected when it comes to particularly consent by verification. So those are my two questions.\n\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): I thank members for further questions. Ayesha Verrall asked about the perceived difference between the ACT - National confidence and supply agreement and the workings of this legislation. As a Minister, I'm not actually responsible for political agreements. All I would say is that I'm a very thoughtful and receptive Minister who's always prepared to make the legislation work in the best interests of all New Zealand. I'll also just make the point that having an applicant, as the member asked, demonstrates that there is a company that will take responsibility for the supply chain within New Zealand. So that is a worthwhile benefit in my view.Peeni Henare asked about what fees these foreign pharmaceutical companies might be charged. I have to say that I'm heartened by the Labour member's concern for foreign pharmaceutical companies; it's a new development, but not an unwelcome one. The fees will be published, they'll be set by regulation, and they will be transparent. But they're not currently set, so that will come as a consequence of the law of passing, if the Parliament decides to pass it.Ingrid Leary repeated the question by Ayesha Verrall and then also asked about the lobbying and political influence on overseas consenting agencies. All I would say is that if you imagine a place like, say, Switzerland, which was in the original bill, or if you imagine a place like the EU or the United Kingdom, your mind doesn't immediately think, I'm sure, that their consenting authorities consent dangerous medicines because of undue influence. I think that would be a surprising thing to most people; there's no evidence to believe that is the case. All of those jurisdictions do have much greater access to medicines than New Zealand and that is one of the things that we are trying to fix here.Going back to Ayesha Verrall, she also asked if it might be that because companies are unlikely to—well, she posits that companies are unlikely to apply for consent if they don't believe they'll ultimately get Pharmac funding. That may be a calculation for some companies, but at the margin what we're doing here is making the consenting process easier and quicker. So you would expect the net effect of that to increase medicines' availability. Of course, any company coming to the New Zealand market will be asking themselves \"Will people actually buy it?\", but that's a commercial decision for them, not one that we can control.Then we had Lawrence Xu-Nan asking about Māori and Pacific populations. But he also, helpfully, answered his own question by pointing to new section 22C(1)(b)(v), inserted by clause 7, where he pointed out that the Minister can consent a medicine if he believes or she believes it \"does not require independent assessment … to contextualise the benefit-risk profile of the medicine due to local disease epidemiology, public health considerations, or New Zealand specific health risks;\". So that is actually covered.Finally, Lawrence Xu-Nan asked if there would be a review clause. Much secondary legislation—I expect all secondary legislation—will be made in best practice.\n\nDr HAMISH CAMPBELL (National—Ilam): I move, That debate on this question now close. Motion agreed to.Part 1 agreed to.\n\nPart 2  Other amendmentsCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Members, we come now to Part 2, the debate on clauses 11 to 13, \"Other amendments\", and the Schedule. The question is that Part 2 stand part.\n\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair. I want to specifically refer to the Minister's Amendment Paper, which was not considered by the select committee. I'd like to take the opportunity to ask the Minister to engage in some back and forth, if we may, on the content of this amendment.CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Encouraged by the Chair.Hon Dr AYESHA VERRALL: Minister, what does your amendment do? [Member knocks over her glass of water]\n\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): Look, I realise that the Chamber can get exciting at this time of night. The amendment simply allows a promoter of a medical conference—you can imagine a place where the primary audience is people who are registered as clinicians under the health practitioners assurance legislation. If you're holding such a conference, then you can get consent to advertise medicines that are not currently consented by Medsafe. The reason that you would want to do that is that clinicians go to these sorts of conferences, in part, precisely because they would like to find out about medicines that are new. Presently, our laws actually forbid those medicines being advertised, and the practical result of that is that doctors—I even happen to know some—go to nice places like Fiji or Noosa, to go to these conferences and learn about the latest and best medicines emerging in the world, and they take their money with them. I've seen one estimate, and if I recall off the top of my head, the net benefit to New Zealand of allowing these medical conferences to happen here in New Zealand will be around about $90 million. It's very simple. We're aligning our rules with the places that New Zealand doctors are currently going. So, instead of going to Noosa or Fiji, they can stay somewhere nice, like Auckland, and learn about new medicines.\n\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): In the spirit of back and forth, thank you to the Minister for that answer. Why is the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act used to define which professions or regulated practitioners in the Act. Their conferences are the ones that are covered by this amendment. Why is that done and is it relevant to the operation of this clause that in an international conference many visitors from overseas won't be regulated by that Act, because they will be registered overseas?\n\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Minister for Regulation): First of all, why would we use the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act? Because that is the piece of legislation in New Zealand that defines the professions that you might think of—doctors, clinicians, the kinds of people that you would imagine you would want to learn about new medicines. It seems like a tidy way to do it.The member is correct that there might be people coming from overseas inbound to learn about medicines at conferences in New Zealand, but I would interpret this as those people are people who come under the same professions and, indeed, would be regulated under that Act if they were in New Zealand. Of course, in this instance they wouldn't be, but they're equivalents. They just happen to be from overseas.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Mr Chair, just to conclude this—CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Dr Ayesha Verrall—I'll facilitate this.\n\nHon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour): This concern about medical conferences was raised in the course of the last Parliament's debate on the Therapeutic Products Bill, so can the Minister explain why this amendment has appeared in the bill now? Why wasn't it in the original bill that was drafted and considered and went to select committee? Why did the Minister's intention with respect to this concern, which has been well known about for some time, change? Perhaps the Minister would like to elaborate on the prospects of a medicinal products bill. Has the prospect of a medicinal products bill passing in this Parliament declined, and is that why this amendment is going through with this bill?\n\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): Well, first of all, I regularly receive praise for having a range of fine qualities, but not in this sense. So why would we not put this in the bill initially? Because we were preparing a bill primarily for the purpose for the rule of two. Once it was brought to my attention that it would be useful for New Zealand clinicians to be able to have medical conferences with advertised medicines in New Zealand, I made a judgment that it was well worth enabling that at the earlier opportunity, which is this bill.The Minister—it's not really part of this debate; if she wants to speculate if there is now not going to be a medical products bill. I wouldn't speak for my colleague Casey Costello, who has that responsibility, but I wouldn't underestimate her either.\n\nRICARDO MENÉNDEZ MARCH (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. Some follow-up questions on the amendment which, Ayesha Verrall noted, was introduced without select committee scrutiny.I noted that the Minister mentioned that such conferences—if I heard correctly—were to bring $90 million to the country. Can I just test where that figure came from, and who produced the analysis on that amount of money? Also whether, as part of that, there was any distributional analysis of, I guess, where that money goes into in terms of who benefits from that?The other question I had in relationship to the amendment was that it seems to me like this is obviously something that had been considered for a while, but can the Minister list the range of stakeholders or entities that have been consulted, if at all, to prepare this amendment? Because, again, we've heard feedback from the Minister in his initial remarks around some of the bodies which he talked about wanting this, but can I check what official engagements happened to produce this amendment, if any? Also, additionally, at what dates did the Minister start the work to prepare this amendment—because that's an important part of the question in relationship to Ayesha Verrall's point, which is that if this had been considered for quite some time, why was this not flagged at the select committee stage?So, to recap, I'm interested to know where the $90 million figure came from; the distributional analysis for benefits; additionally, the list of stakeholders or entities that were consulted; as well as the issue of the date that the Minister started to prepare this amendment.A follow-up question on that would be in relationship to the list of stakeholders and entities that would have been consulted with. Did he receive any feedback of which regional centres in our country are most likely to benefit from these medical conferences, if at all?\n\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): As I said at the time, the $90 million was a figure off the top of my head. I'm not relying on that to justify this change, and I don't want to start quoting if I might misquote. But it is a figure that I've heard and share in candour with the committee.As far as the distributional analysis is concerned, I also don't have that. I only have the headline figure. In terms of consultation, I haven't directly consulted people with this. I've had it proposed—the ministry's recommended it—and I believe that if we can remove a restriction that will make sure that people can do more to make New Zealand a wealthier and more interesting place, then we should do that.In terms of the date, I started thinking about it. I couldn't give you an exact date off the top of my head but I'd be happy to talk to the member later if he is really interested in that.\n\nRICARDO MENÉNDEZ MARCH (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. I'm a little bit concerned to hear that the $90 million was kind of made up on the spot. I guess the question I had in relationship to that—or from the top of his head—is whether he asked any Government body to do some analysis on that figure? I can totally accept that, maybe, he just doesn't have a thought in his head, but I do want to know whether he actually asked his officials to explore exactly how much revenue it could bring. It's OK if that figure is not in front of him, but I do want to ask whether that question was part of the process to get this amendment sorted.The reason why I ask this is because the bill, so far, has had quite constructive cross-party consensus. I would hope that this amendment and the way that this is presented also seeks to do that very same thing. But without having clarity of exactly the robust analysis that was being made from the Minister to corroborate, for example, the amount of revenue it could bring to the country, it's hard for us to be able to quantify the benefits of this amendment.To recap, I'm interested to know if he did actually ask for any advice on the amount of money such an amendment and these medical conferences could bring to the country; and if he did not commission such advice, then what basis is he using to get to a point where he feels confident about the amount of money that such an amendment will bring to the country?\n\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Health): I can only repeat my previous comment. The justification for this does not rely on any specific figure. If it was $9 million, $90 million, or $900 million, it costs next to nothing to do, and it increases people's freedom to do as they please within New Zealand so long as there are no risks to others, and, therefore, we should do it.\n\nTOM RUTHERFORD (National—Bay of Plenty): I move, That debate on this question now close.Motion agreed to.\n\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): The question is that the Minister's amendments set out on Amendment Paper 425 be agreed to.A party vote was called for on the question, That the amendments be agreed to.Ayes 102New Zealand National 49; New Zealand Labour 34; ACT New Zealand 11; New Zealand First 8.Noes 21Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand 15; Te Pāti Māori 6.Amendments agreed to.Part 2 as amended agreed to.\n\nClauses 1 to 3CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Members, we come now the debate on clauses 1 to 3—title, commencement, and principal Act.

We begin with the debate on Part 1. This is the debate on clauses 3 to 15, Amendments to the Crimes Act 1961. The question is that Part 1 stand part.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. I want to start by going clause to clause, because there are quite a few things to unpack. I want to start with clause 4, which inserts section 2A, \"Meaning of person who owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand\".One of things we had a question on—and it's one of the things we've been trying to tease out in the select committee—is the broader idea of what it means when someone owes allegiance to a particular location. This came up when we were talking about someone, for example, who may not have the citizenship of a particular country but at the same time has whakapapa to a particular country and as part of the whakapapa may experience of may express certain intentions or feelings, and whether they are going to be captured in this legislation.It is something that is complex, considering we heard in the previous bills that we do have very diverse communities here in Aotearoa, and the Greens have some concerns around the definition we see here, for example, in section 2A(3)(c), because I think it takes a very pure form of definition that doesn't take in broader complexities of the whakapapa of the person, or the heritage or the ancestry of the person. So I just want to check with the Minister to start off with, on some of that consideration as he develops this bill and the intentions behind it.\n\nHon PAUL GOLDSMITH (Minister of Justice): This legislation is not changing our citizenship laws or making amendments in any of those areas. What it does do is create new offences relating to foreign interference in the Crimes Act. Just by way of introduction, it's a bill that would create an offence if a person engages in covert, deceptive, coercive, or corruptive conduct on behalf of a foreign power to intentionally compromise a protected New Zealand interest, or is reckless as to whether their conduct is likely to compromise such an interest, or commits an imprisonable offence to intentionally benefit a foreign power, or is reckless as to whether committing that offence is likely to provide such a benefit. So that's the primary focus.What we're trying to do here is to deal with the reality. A lot of people would seek to deny that there is a problem, but the Government is firmly of the view that foreign interference is something that we are concerned about as a nation. So we're updating our legislation to be clear about that. What we're not doing is changing our citizenship laws.\n\nHon Dr DUNCAN WEBB (Labour—Christchurch Central): Thank you, Mr Chair. I'll pick up where my friend and colleague Lawrence Xu-Nan left off, on clause 4, new section 2A, which does touch on the slightly arcane subject of the meaning of a person who \"owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand\". This is, basically, a loyalty question in the old-fashioned sense of the word—that is to say, for someone who owes allegiance to the Crown, under this legislation it is a criminal offence to work against the interests of the Crown.Whilst the Minister noted that this doesn't change immigration law—I accept that—there is an interface between immigration status and who owes allegiance to the Crown. One thing that is clear here is that anyone who is a citizen owes allegiance to the Crown, but, from the legislation, it's not immediately clear to me—and I'd appreciate the Minister's elucidation; I see he's flying solo tonight, which is probably a good thing—about other immigration statuses. In new section 2A(3)(c), it says, \"[any person] not bound by the oath of allegiance:\". Essentially, you can't be found guilty of this offence. There is a series of categories of people. One would be a person on a resident's visa. Is a person on a resident's visa bound by the oath of allegiance? Is a person on a worker's visa bound by the oath of allegiance?I think, when we get down to the categories where it's clearly not the case—for example, someone on a visitor or tourist visa, who, if they engaged in what are, essentially, subversive activities, would not be criminally responsible for foreign interference, because they're not bound by the oath of allegiance. But the one a little bit higher up from the tourist and visitor visas—workers, Recognised Seasonal Employers workers, or people on perhaps a two- or three-year worker's visa—if they engage in activities which are there to benefit a foreign State by deception, which is at the root of this, as we'll come to, would a person on a worker's visa or a resident's visa be subject to this legislation, or are they persons who owe allegiance to the Sovereign of New Zealand?It would be really appreciated if the Minister could give some elucidation there, because, ultimately, I think we accept that if people come into New Zealand and they're on a pathway to residence—ultimately, a pathway to citizenship, which is the highest status, including residency—we expect them to be loyal, ultimately, because this is what this legislation is at root about, to New Zealand. If they come from a foreign country, wherever that might be, which has different interests and wants to undermine New Zealand's economic or security interests and they want to, I don't know, pass information back to the other State or to engage in conduct that undermines the interests of New Zealand, as workers or with an immigration status other than that of citizen, ultimately the question is this: are they captured by this?If they're not, there's quite a hole here. Look, if you're a spy—let's say what this is about—and you're a resident but not a citizen, you've got a free pass; you'll continue passing information and undermining the interests of New Zealand in the interests of the other State with pretty much impunity. I think it would be really good if the Minister could go through and say, \"Here's where the line is. Here is where you owe allegiance to New Zealand, and here's where you don't.\" That would be a really helpful elucidation by the Minister.\n\nVANUSHI WALTERS (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair. I have some new and different questions for the Minister, but they are about the same new section 2A. This is the section about who owes allegiance. During the course of submissions, the New Zealand Law Society wrote a lot on this section and asked several questions, some of which were addressed by the amended version of the bill, but some weren't. I just thought I would use the opportunity to get the Minister's clarification on where he thinks these situations would fall.The first is: who counts as a person in the context of the Ross Dependency? There are potential difficulties with the reference to persons in New Zealand due to the need to reconcile respective sections in the Crimes Act and the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977 definitions. The interaction of the Crimes Act definition of New Zealand with provisions of the other Act is unclear, in my view. Section 2 of the Crimes Act defines New Zealand as including \"all waters within the outer limits of the territorial sea of New Zealand (as defined by section 3 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977\", but section 3 of that Act defines the territorial sea as encompassing the sea within 12 nautical miles of a baseline, being the low water mark along the coast of New Zealand, including the coast of all islands.The statutes don't fit together well, and the Law Society made this argument as well—that there is a good argument that the bill enacted in its current form wouldn't apply to the Ross Dependency. Now, that might entirely be the Minister's intent, but I think that, at this stage of the House's work, it's useful for us to clarify that. The Law Society suggested that, potentially, there could be an amendment here to make it clearer. Similarly, they spoke about how the law would apply to Niue. It's stated, of course, in section 3 of the Niue Constitution Act that it shall be self-governing; however, section 6 provides that \"Nothing in this Act or in the Constitution shall affect the responsibilities of Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand for the external affairs and defence of Niue.\" The question is, really, whether the Minister's view is that that would also mean that people would fall within that sense of allegiance as well.The other issue that the Law Society spoke about was the statement that the common law would continue to apply rather than specify what the common law is in terms of who owes allegiance and who doesn't. They particularly pointed to the issue of renouncing citizenship or repudiating allegiance, and, in the Law Society's view, there would be some merit in actually stepping through, within the statute, who that includes and who it doesn't. In many ways, it would seem absurd if someone were to validly, and with documentation, renounce their citizenship, and potentially be living overseas as well, but, through some interpretation of the common law, be determined to still fall within one of the people who did continue to owe allegiance.Another matter that I have been reflecting on since select committee, and I can't recall that this came up within the select committee itself, is the issue of New Zealanders who are working within foreign embassies and the treatment of them both overseas as well as in New Zealand. Presumably, it would apply to individuals who are staff of other embassies in New Zealand—I know that embassies often attempt to recruit from home countries, but, again, it's not unusual for administrative staff to be locally recruited. How would the bill, when enacted, apply to them, but also New Zealanders who may be employed in foreign embassies, potentially with dual citizenship as well? While that feels clear in the context of being within New Zealand, if the Minister could respond to those individuals who are working in embassies outside of New Zealand, I would be grateful.\n\nHon Dr DUNCAN WEBB (Labour—Christchurch Central): I'm looking forward to the Minister of Justice's elucidation of these points, once he gets some advice, obviously. But, look, one of the things that's really interesting here—because this is the Crimes Act, right? The Crimes (Countering Foreign Interference) Amendment Bill creates a crime and the trigger is that if you're going to do bad things hurting the interests of New Zealand, the flip side is that to be criminally responsible, you have to owe allegiance to the Sovereign of New Zealand.Then, in the new section 2A(2), inserted by clause 4, it says, \"this section is not an exhaustive code of the law relating to the circumstances in which a person owes allegiance to the Sovereign … of New Zealand;\", so it's just opened the gate. The thing about criminal law is that you want to be pretty clear about when you're liable, when you could be charged with a crime, right? A lot of the bill kind of steps through—my previous contribution talked about, well, what about if you're a resident? What about if you're a tourist? What about if you're on a worker's visa and so on. There are going to be clear yes or no answers to that.The question here is what the hell does it mean to say it's not an exhaustive code as to whether or not you owe allegiance to the Sovereign of New Zealand? Is there going to be some situation where, to take a recent instance, you are a child of a person who is tangata whenua who has a moral claim to citizenship, and you're a spy for a foreign State in a foreign country—does that mean you could conceivably owe allegiance to the Sovereign of New Zealand or basically, what else? Why do we need a vague, open-ended framework that says, \"Here are the circumstances where you do owe allegiance. Here are the circumstances where you don't, but just for a lack of clarity, that's not everything. There could be something else, but we'll let you know that when we get round to it.\" That's ultimately what phrasing like \"this section is not an exhaustive code of the law relating to the circumstances in which a person owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand;\" means.So you could be a person who might, for whatever reason, hold in high esteem the interests of another State and you might be gleaning information from situations you're in and secretly passing it on to another State. All of a sudden you land in New Zealand and you say, \"Well, I'm not a citizen. I'm not a resident. I'm not even on a worker's permit.\", but the authorities say, \"Ah, but no, that's not an exhaustive code. You're not allowed to glean information in that way, because we think you owe allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand in some other way.\"So it is a concern that we've got a criminal statute which kind of harks back to the Star Chamber where you kind of made things up as you went along, where you just said, \"We are of the view that it is appropriate in the circumstances kind of ex post facto to impose liability.\" So I'd be interested in the Minister's own observations, clearly, on when there might be something which is not captured by the rules in the subsequent parts of the section but nevertheless, someone could owe allegiance because, actually, this is the trigger for liability here and it's a relatively serious thing, so I'd be interested in the Minister's observations there.\n\nHon PAUL GOLDSMITH (Minister of Justice): I can respond to the concerns about who's in and who's out by just referring to the bill where it says, in new section 2A(3), \"A person who is in New Zealand owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand\"—anybody who's in New Zealand owes allegiance to the Sovereign—\"unless 1 or more of the following apply:\". One and two are, essentially, diplomats, and three is a person who's an enemy alien—i.e., somebody that we're at war with—and is not a New Zealand citizen and is not bound by the Oath of Allegiance, or a child of such a person.Everybody who's here in the country is somebody who owes allegiance to the Sovereign if they're in the country, unless they're a diplomat or a person who is an enemy alien. It's reasonably clearly outlined in the legislation, and I think we're getting slightly distracted, trying to draw what this legislation here is, which is focused on dealing with foreign interference, which is a real threat that we face, and I don't think it's helpful to try and draw into a debate around citizen rights of children of actors in relation to this topic.\n\nTEANAU TUIONO (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair, and thank you to the Minister for engaging on this topic as well. I note the comments made by Vanushi Walters around Niue and the Ross Dependency, and also, as a Cook Islander, I'm interested as well, because Cook Islanders hold New Zealand passports. The Cook Islands and Niue are part of the New Zealand Realm—so, technically, in New Zealand. So it would be good for the Minister to draw out exactly what that would mean for Cook Islanders in this instance, because I know that people will be listening with interest as to whether they owe allegiance, and exactly what that means. We have seen in recent events in the Cook Islands where there has been a difference of opinion around the relationship with China, for example, and concerns both in the Islands themselves and here within the Cooks Islands community as well.So the issue of who owes allegiance to whom is an important one, because it poses a lot of questions that actually need specific answers in terms of the allegiance to the Sovereign. What exactly does the Minister mean in this particular case; how does it pertain to Pacific Islanders who are part of the New Zealand Realm; and what will that do in terms of the ability of people in those countries to be able to express a different opinion, to be able to have different relationships with different foreign countries? Whether we like those relationships here in Wellington here or not, there are possibilities and ways for them to be able to engage in those relationships.So I think it's an incredibly important issue around what allegiance to the Sovereign actually looks like, and I do agree with the point made by Dr Duncan Webb about this being not an exhaustive code as well, because I know that people in the Pacific Islands will be worried about whether they fall within that non-exhaustive code as well. So these are important questions and it would be good to get some answers from the Minister.\n\nVANUSHI WALTERS (Labour): Thank you, Mr Chair. I did have another question in relation to this new section that's going to be inserted as to whether the Minister of Justice considered the concept of temporary allegiance, which is actually a concept that has deep historical roots. In Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England published in 1765, it suggested that allegiance arising from birth in England was inalienable, but that there was also something that was temporary allegiance owed to the King by aliens only while resident in England. So that was one argument; that you only owed this allegiance to the King while you were there under, as Dr Webb has suggested, maybe temporary circumstances—that could be expected of you while you were in New Zealand, for example.The other argument that also has come out of Blackstone's very early arguments on this historic concept of temporary allegiance is the idea of a ligament of allegiance, in that you might owe allegiance to the Crown, but similarly, the Crown owes obligations to you. Prior to the statute of treason in 1351—when the common law purely applied—there was an argument that that was the way in which one should formulate what allegiance is; that you only have that obligation in so far as the Crown is complying with its obligations. If the Crown fails to do so, then those obligations no longer exist, or they may exist in some sort of diminished state.So my first question is really whether that was brought into the Minister's thinking in terms of framing how there might be temporary allegiance obligations of those people who are temporarily in New Zealand, quite rightly? Many of them come with other citizenship obligations, which they don't derogate from when they come to New Zealand. They may still vote in those elections that are happening overseas as well, and so we should bear in mind those more nuanced ways of understanding allegiance and build them into legislation at the get-go.The other question I have on this is whether there was consideration for a carve-out or an exemption from liability if there was an officially induced error? This was another proposal that was put forward by one of the submitters where there could be merit in including an officially induced error defence in the section, which would apply where a person has formally sought advice from the New Zealand Government as to whether they owe allegiance to the Crown in the right of New Zealand and they're advised that they did not. So they've sought that advice, the advice has come through saying that they're not, and, subsequently, they're charged with an offence under these new provisions. It's almost that reliance defence where one would think that, ordinarily, that person had a reasonable excuse. If they do, then that ought to be written specifically into statute.I circle back to the Law Society's point about being very specific about what is and isn't included here, rather than adopting general language that the common law applies, because we are talking about a serious offence. We are talking about a taint as well after someone might be convicted of this offence. So it is very important that we get this clear.Again, just wanting the Minister's consideration or thoughts, reflections on whether temporary allegiance was considered as a concept; if not, why not? Particularly for those on temporary class visas and his views about the exception: should it be in there? Does he believe that it falls within the common law scope of what would be excluded if that person relied on advice from the Government or would they otherwise be held to be accountable for breaching the provisions of this new law, even if they had that advice from the Government that they didn't owe that allegiance?\n\nHon PAUL GOLDSMITH (Minister of Justice): In relation to the last question about whether we considered views, I'm not sure the extent to which detailed consideration of temporary allegiance was given, but we have certainly not decided to go down that route. In relation to our friend from the Greens' reference to \"people may be expressing different views\"—I think was the phrase he used; I might have got that wrong—from different parts of the Realm expressing different views: this is not a question of free speech or expressing views. It's about people who engage in covert, deceptive, coercive, or corruptive conduct for or on behalf of a foreign power to intentionally compromise a protected New Zealand interest, or as reckless as to whether that conduct is likely to compromise an interest. So we're not talking about expressing views. It's a very different thing indeed.\n\nDr LAWRENCE XU-NAN (Green): Thank you, Mr Chair. I do understand where the Minister's coming from, and I think that foreign interference is incredibly serious. Even if you're looking at something that we'll touch on later, in terms of clause 7—if you're looking at section 69 of the Crimes Act, particularly new subsection (1B), inserted by clause 7(1), it is punishable by up to 14 years of imprisonment. So we understand the severity of it, which is why this new definition that has been introduced, of the meaning of a person who owes allegiance, is particularly important because this is the crux of a lot of what is going to be coming in terms of the rest of the bill, in terms of the actual offence itself.Now, I know that my colleagues have touched on persons \"in New Zealand\". I actually want to focus more on persons \"outside of New Zealand\". Understanding that, when we're looking at new section 2A(4)(a), (b), and (c), inserted by clause 4—certain areas like, for example, (c)(i) and (b) are potentially relatively easily understood. But I want to focus on subsection 4(c)(iii), which is \"has family or property in New Zealand that demonstrates an enduring connection to New Zealand.\" Now, this section is a new section: section 2A. It comes immediately after section 2 of the Crimes Act, \"Interpretation\". Therefore, any words that are coming out of 2A will be leveraged off the interpretation or definition that comes under section 2.The reason I focus on this section is that under section 2 of the Crimes Act's, under \"Interpretation\", there is no definition of \"family\". So how broad is \"family\"? I understand that potentially the keyword here is \"enduring connection\" but just hold on to that thought for the time being. \"Family\" is not defined in the interpretation section; property is. \"Property\" in section 2 is defined as \"includes real and personal property, and any estate or interest in any real or personal property, money, electricity, and any debt, and any thing in action and any other right or right or interest\". So \"property\" has an incredibly broad definition in section 2. If we consider \"enduring connection\", who then determines what that enduring connection is and how broad we make it? Is \"family\" immediate? Is \"family\" a great, great, great-aunt? Is \"family\" second cousin twice removed? That \"enduring connection\" is not clear.Now, I do want to combine that with what is in new section 2A(4A) and (4B), which is \"Interpretation\". It says in (4B) that where it is a question of law, \"the prosecutor or the defendant may adduce\"—may adduce. So in the event of what we're seeing in terms of defences, does the person need to then be arrested first, stand trial, and then, in this case, is it for the judge or evidence heard by the jury to determine what that enduring connection is? In those kinds of events, how many people are going to be potentially held under the definition of new section 2A(3) of a person who owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand, if they have, like I said, a great, great-aunt or a second cousin twice removed here in Aotearoa New Zealand or property? I see they may have accrued a debt or a parking fine from travels that they've done here in New Zealand; potentially one day they may want to come back. Is that considered an enduring relationship?Those are my three questions. What is the definition of \"family\"—four questions, sorry. What is the definition of \"family\", definition of \"property\", definition of \"enduring connection\", and does it mean that the judge or evidence heard by a jury will need to determine that after the person has been arrested?\n\nHon Dr DUNCAN WEBB (Labour—Christchurch Central): Thank you, Mr Chair. Just moving on to clause 7, which inserts new section 69(1A). This is quite interesting because it's actually not strictly about foreign interference; it's about an allied series of offences, which are kind of treason and mutiny. But I have a quite specific question here, because the new subsection (1A) talks about \"A person who owes allegiance to the sovereign in right of New Zealand commits an offence if the person, outside of New Zealand, aids, incites, counsels, or procures the doing or omission outside [of] New Zealand, by any person not owing allegiance to the Sovereign … New Zealand … any act which, if done … by a person owing such allegiance, would be any of the crimes mentioned in subsection (1).\" Subsection (1) mentions, amongst other things, treason and mutiny. So, basically, you can't find someone who doesn't owe allegiance and then use them as your tool to commit the crimes of mutiny.Then, new subsection (1B) says, \"A person who commits an offence against subsection (1A) is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.\" Well, there's a couple of things in there. Firstly, if you look at the Crimes Act, which we've got to remember, Minister, was drafted in 1961, and a few clauses haven't—it doesn't look like they've been reviewed since then, because \"mutiny\" includes some strange language. Mutiny is: endeavouring at any time to seduce any person serving in the New Zealand forces from his or her duty. So a strange use of language there, but, essentially, seeking to induce someone not to do their duty, to breach their duty as a member of the armed forces. But the interesting thing is this: the penalty for inciting to mutiny—that's section 77 of the Crimes Act—is 10 years. The penalty for being a party to inducing someone else to do that is 14 years. Now, usually being a party, that is to say conspiring or, you know—what's the other word? You'll know, Arena Williams. It's usually a lesser offence. So how can it be more serious to incite an offence than to commit an offence? You get 14 years for inciting an offence, but you get 10 years for doing the offence itself. It makes no sense.So if you could explain to me why inciting mutiny is 14 years in prison, but being mutinous is 10 years in prison, that would be a really handy elucidation.And I've got a lot more to go, because this is a very difficult piece of legislation, it's very complex. I'll come to further \"[incitement], counsels, or attempts to procure\", in new subsection 69(2A) at a later time. But if the Minister of Justice would be kind enough to respond to that, that would be very handy.CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): At the risk of leaving the House in suspense, the time has come for me to report progress.Progress to be reported.House resumed.\n\nREPORT OF COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSECHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Madam Speaker, the committee has considered the Crimes (Countering Foreign Interference) Amendment Bill and reports that it has made progress on the bill.
