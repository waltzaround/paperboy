  "publicationDate": "2025-11-13",
  "summary": "Parliament saw the final passage of the highly contentious Regulatory Standards Bill, a cornerstone of the ACT party's agenda, which fundamentally alters how new laws are scrutinized. The government hailed it as a victory for accountability, while opposition parties condemned it as an undemocratic move and pledged its repeal. The day also featured heated exchanges over budget cuts to Fire and Emergency NZ, the government's redress plan for abuse survivors, and proposed changes to meat inspection services.",

      "whyItMatters": "This new law changes how all future government regulations are created and assessed, requiring them to be measured against principles that prioritize individual liberty and property rights.",
      "content": "The government passed the Regulatory Standards Bill into law, concluding a years-long campaign by the ACT Party. Minister for Regulation David Seymour argued the bill creates a more \"civilised society\" by forcing politicians to be transparent about the costs of regulation on individuals and their property, similar to how the Public Finance Act provides fiscal accountability. Opposition parties fiercely opposed the bill, with Labour's Dr Duncan Webb stating it \"bakes in a libertarian set of values\" and was opposed by over 99% of public submitters. The Green Party and Te Pāti Māori argued it prioritizes corporate interests and property over people, the environment, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi, with both Labour and the Greens vowing to repeal the legislation within 100 days of forming a new government.",

      "content": "The Labour opposition challenged the government over proposed budget cuts of up to $70 million a year and the potential loss of 140 jobs at Fire and Emergency New Zealand. Deputy Leader Carmel Sepuloni questioned the timing of the cuts, referencing a recent major fire in Tongariro National Park and asking if public safety could be guaranteed. Acting Prime Minister David Seymour defended the government's position, stating FENZ had been asked to \"manage within a budget\" and that efficiency could be improved by \"working smarter\" rather than \"throwing money at a problem.\" He argued that better asset management, which he claimed was neglected under the previous government, would ensure firefighters are well-resourced without impacting safety.",

Labour's Rachel Brooking challenged the Acting Minister for Food Safety, Mark Patterson, on whether this would put New Zealand's \"gold-standard reputation at risk.\" Mr. Patterson defended the consultation, stating the self-inspection model has been an option since 2013 and is already used for 17% of meat exports without issue.
