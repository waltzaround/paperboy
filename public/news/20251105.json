The Government defended its economic plan and announced major new mining permits, while facing sharp criticism from the Opposition over job losses, controversial changes to climate law, and its approach to homelessness.",

      "whyItMatters": "The latest figures show 160,000 people are now unemployed, impacting household finances and job security across the country.",
      "content": "The release of September quarter labour market data showing a 5.3% unemployment rate triggered the day's most significant political battle. Finance Minister Nicola Willis and Deputy Prime Minister David Seymour argued the figures were forecast by Treasury under the previous Labour government, attributing the economic downturn to their predecessor's \"reckless spending\" and resulting inflation. In response, Leader of the Opposition Chris Hipkins and Labour's Barbara Edmonds attacked the government for the 37,000 jobs lost since it took office, a shrinking economy, and the impact on young people, with one in seven now unemployed.",
