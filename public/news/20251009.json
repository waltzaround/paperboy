  "headline": "Finance Minister Defends Economic Plan Amidst Opposition Attacks on Negative Growth, Job Losses",
  "publicationDate": "2025-10-09",
  "summary": "Parliament was dominated by a fierce debate over the state of the economy, with the Opposition blaming the Government's policies for negative growth and rising unemployment, a charge the Finance Minister vehemently denied. Amid the conflict, the Government announced significant new procurement rules aimed at favouring New Zealand businesses and celebrated the passage of a major marine protection bill for the Hauraki Gulf. The day also saw a new Te Pāti Māori MP sworn in and a procedural error nullify the final vote on a broadcasting bill.",

      "content": "A tense question time saw the Government's economic management heavily challenged by the Labour opposition. Minister of Finance Nicola Willis defended her plan, attributing the country's economic downturn, high interest rates, and rising unemployment to the \"reckless and undisciplined\" spending of the previous government which she said created an \"overheated economy.\" She pointed to her government's tax relief and infrastructure investment as the path to recovery. Labour MPs Barbara Edmonds and Ginny Andersen countered by citing a negative 1.1% annual growth rate, 36,000 more people out of work, a 26% rise in liquidations, and significant job losses in regions like Nelson and Hawke's Bay, arguing these were the direct consequences of the current government's policies.",

      "content": "Minister for Economic Growth Nicola Willis announced a major overhaul of government procurement rules, set to take effect on December 1. The central change introduces an \"economic benefit test,\" which will require government agencies to give a minimum 10% weighting to the wider benefits for New Zealand when assessing bids for over $50 billion in annual contracts. The Minister stated the change would level the playing field for local firms against overseas competitors on price, without breaching international trade agreements. The reform also aims to reduce bureaucracy for small and medium-sized businesses by cutting the number of rules from 71 to 47.",

Minister of Conservation Tama Potaka celebrated the bill's passage, which received support from all parties present, stating it would help recover key species like snapper and rock lobster and boost the region's $100 billion marine economy. However, the bill drew criticism from Labour and the Greens over a late change that allows for some commercial fishing to continue within high-protection areas. Opponents argued this set a dangerous precedent influenced by industry lobbyists, while the Minister defended it as a necessary compromise to secure the bill's passage.",

      "content": "The third and final reading of the Broadcasting (Repeal of Advertising Restrictions) Amendment Bill was dramatically halted after a procedural error. The bill, intended to provide an estimated $6 million in annual revenue for struggling local broadcasters by allowing advertising on days like Anzac Day morning and Easter Sunday, faced a divided House. While Labour and ACT supported it on grounds of fairness against unregulated digital platforms, the Green Party and NZ First opposed it, arguing it eroded the sanctity of special holidays for minimal financial gain. When a personal (conscience) vote was held, fewer than the required 20 members were present in the chamber, rendering the vote void and interrupting the bill's passage until the next sitting day.",
